* Space exploration is hard
* One of the reasons for this is significant latency
* Therefore, autonomy is very helpful
* How do we create autonomous systems?
* Typically, one creates a system which may take many different actions, and use design a control system to choose which action to take and when
* Two major approaches: control theory and artificial intelligence
* Control theory works great when we can mathematically formalise the system, its environment, and the desired behaviour; in other words, it's a bottom-up approach
* Artificial intelligence can be described as a top-down approach, and provides techniques to use when the problem is hard to mathematically characterise
* But we still have the problem of trying to describe the desired behaviour
===========


* Planetary rovers, and other space science platforms, are increasingly being designed to maximise their autonomy.
* This requires mathematically describing desired behaviours.
* How do we mathematically describe "do some science" when we don't know what we are looking for?
* We define science as systematic curiosity
* Curiosity as a behaviour may be described as trying to maximising interestingness.
* We aren't curious about things which are completely predictable, nor about things which appear completely random
* Thus, one information-theoretic approach to interestingness is a nonmonotonic measure of similarity to previously understood information
* One application of information theory, compression, works by finding and exploiting similarity in the given data by creating probabilistic models
* This is exactly why we want the data anyway - analyse it to discover and model the process which creates it
* Thus, we can use compression to formalise curiosity
* This realisation leads to many interesting questions. Some include:
  - How can we use these models for the purpose of science?
  - Or use them to improve the autonomy of our hypothetical robotic cosmonaut?
* Most extant compression doesn't actively ask for additional data to improve its models
* We propose to investigate compression schemes based on physical principles and their use in autonomous agents guided by artificial curiosity, which can perform scientific experiments to gather more data for model building.
