  abstract = {The complex confrontation in robot soccer match requires the decision-making system to learn the priori-knowledge given by humans and learn from its own experience. The two learning issues are usually addressed in two phases: off-line learning and on-line learning. Though lots of methods have been developed to address the two issues separately, the construction of a fully autonomous intelligent decision-making system remains challenging because of the difficulty of connecting the two phases. Most existing intelligent decision-making systems focus on only one of the two phases consequently. The model and algorithms of the Bayesian SOM neural network are proposed in this paper, based on which a fully autonomous intelligent decision-making system for robot soccer is built. This model provides a knowledge structure which can be shared by the off-line learning and on-line learning algorithms. By integrating the Bayesian classifier into each neuron, the whole neural network is equivalent to a multi-agent decision-making system. In the on-line learning phase, the Bayesian method is used to update each neuron's beliefs and the whole network's estimation of the state space. In matches with different opponents, this Bayesian SOM intelligent decision-making system showed outstanding learning ability and great adaptivity. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel failure-tolerant architecture for future robotic spacecraft. It is based on the Time and Space Partitioning (TSP) principle as well as a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional concepts for system failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR). Contrary to classic payload that is separated from the platform, robotic devices attached onto a satellite become an integral part of the spacecraft itself. Hence, the robot needs to be integrated into the overall satellite FDIR concept in order to prevent fatal damage upon hardware or software failure. In addition, complex dexterous manipulators as required for onorbit servicing (OOS) tasks may reach unexpected failure states, where classic FDIR methods reach the edge of their capabilities with respect to successfully detecting and resolving them. Combining, and partly replacing traditional methods with flexible AI approaches aims to yield a control environment that features increased robustness, safety and reliability for space robots. The developed architecture is based on a modular on-board operational framework that features deterministic partition scheduling, an OS abstraction layer and a middleware for standardized inter-component and external communication. The supervisor (SUV) concept is utilized for exception and health management as well as deterministic system control and error management. In addition, a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) approach was implemented yielding a real-time robot sensor confidence analysis and failure detection. The SOM features nonsupervized training given a typical set of defined world states. By compiling a set of reviewable three-dimensional maps, alternative strategies in case of a failure can be found, increasing operational robustness. As demonstrator, a satellite simulator was set up featuring a client satellite that is to be captured by a servicing satellite with a 7-DoF dexterous manipulator. The avionics and robot control were integrated on an embedded, space-qualified Airbus e.Cube on-board computer. The experiments showed that the integration of SOM for robot failure detection positively complemented the capabilities of traditional FDIR methods. \&copy; 2015 IEEE.},

With the momentum conservation relations, system dynamics model was set up by the Lagrange method. Using the two-time scale decomposition of singular perturbation method, and the system was decomposed into a slow subsystem which was described joint trajectory tracking and a fast subsystem which was described the vibration of flexible manipulator. Then a composite controller consisting of a slow control component and a fast control component was proposed. For the slow subsystem, adaptive fuzzy H. control algorithm was designed, the fuzzy logic system was used to approximate the system uncertainty, and a robust H control was used to overcome the fuzzy approximation errors and eliminate the influences of the external disturbance on the output tracking errors. For the fast subsystem, optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) was designed to damp out the vibration of the flexible links. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that this algorithm can ensure the control system is asymptotically stable. Numerical simulation results illustrate that the proposed controller is reliable and effective, this control scheme makes the tracking errors of the system and the flexible vibrations quickly convergence.},

  abstract = {Automatic cloud recognition promises significant improvements in Earth science remote sensing. At any time, more than half of Earth's surface is covered by clouds, obscuring images and atmospheric measurements. This is particularly problematic for CubeSats, a new generation of small, low-orbiting spacecraft with very limited communications bandwidth. Such spacecraft can use image analysis to autonomously select clear scenes for prioritized downlink. More agile spacecraft can also benefit from cloud screening by retargeting observations to cloud-free areas. This could significantly improve the science yield of instruments such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 mission. However, most existing cloud detection algorithms are not suitable for these applications, because they require calibrated and georectified spectral data, which is not typically available onboard. Here, we describe a statistical machine-learning method for real-time autonomous scene interpretation using a visible camera with no radiometric calibration. A random forest classifies cloud and clear pixels based on local patterns of image texture. We report on experimental evaluation of images from the International Space Station (ISS) and present results from a deployment onboard the IPEX spacecraft. This demonstrates actual execution in flight and provides some preliminary lessons learned about operational use. It is a rare example of a machine-learning system deployed to an autonomous spacecraft. To our knowledge, it is also the first instance of significant artificial intelligence deployed on board a CubeSat and the first ever deployment of visible image-based cloud screening onboard any operational spacecraft. \&copy; 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Preliminary examples of this approach have been given and discussed. It will be our task in the future to fully integrate all these concepts in our mobile manipulation systems. However, we need to go further than that: on the electromechanical side, sensors integrated into the mechanical structures are of outmost importance as well as powerful, decentralized, intelligent joint controllers. On the control and algorithmic side, the architectural concept will have to be implemented by means of integrating a wide variety of algorithms from control to adaptation, from sensor fusion and representation to planning and learning, to name just a few.

The architecture forms the basis for a testbed system which allows researchers to develop, test, and evaluate different hardware and software approaches.

One of the main applications is to guide the robotic arm of a space servicing satellite: in such a mission, one of the priorities is to reduce disturbances on the satellite attitude induced by robotic arm movements so as not to perturb the pointing position of the satellite. A robot whose base has both mass and inertia of the same order of magnitude of its robotic arm is considered - in this configuration the disturbance of the satellite attitude is not negligible. Objective is to plan the robot's arm motion in such a way as the end-effector tracks a desired trajectory while disturbances on the base's attitude are minimized. This objective is achieved by taking into account the coupling between the arm and the floating base of the robot in the kinematic inversion of the guiding control, controlling the gain matrix of the subtask introduced in the kinematic inversion equation by means of a fuzzy algorithm. The proposed strategy combines the advantages of the inverse kinematic algorithm and a fuzzy logic approach.},

  abstract = {Curiosity is an essential driving force for science
as well as technology, and has led mankind
to explore its surroundings, all the way to our current
understanding of the universe. Space science
and exploration is at the pinnacle of each of
these developments, in that it requires the most advanced
technology, explores our world and outer
space, and constantly pushes the frontier of scientific
knowledge. Manned space missions carry disproportionate
costs and risks, so it is only natural
for the field to strive for autonomous exploration.
While recent innovations in engineering, robotics
and AI provide solutions to many sub-problems
of autonomous exploration, insufficient emphasis
has been placed on the higher level question of
autonomously deciding what to explore. Artifi-
cial curiosity, the subject of this paper, precisely addresses
this issue. We will introduce formal notions
of “interestingness” based on the concepts of (1)
compression progress through discovery of novel
regularities in the observations, and (2) coherence
progress through selection of data that “fits” the
already known data in a compression-based way.
Further, we discuss how to construct a system that
exhibits curiosity driven by the interestingness of
certain types of novel observations, with the mission
to curiously go where no probe has gone before.},

Taking the limited working time and the arduous task of the astronauts in the space station into account, an astronaut assistant robot (AAR-2) applied in the space station is proposed and designed in this paper. The AAR-2 is achieved with some improvements on the basis of AAR-1 which was designed before. It can exploit its position and attitude sensors and control system to free flight or hover in the space cabin. And it also has a definite environmental awareness and artificial intelligence to complete some specified tasks under the control of astronauts or autonomously. In this paper, it mainly analyzes and controls the 6-DOF motion of the AAR-2. Firstly, the system configuration of AAR-2 is specifically described, and the movement principles are analyzed. Secondly, according to the physical model of the AAR-2, the Newton - Euler equation is applied in the preparation of space dynamics model of 6-DOF motion. Then, according to the mathematical model's characteristics which are nonlinear and strong coupling, a dual closed loop position and attitude controller based on fuzzy sliding mode control is proposed and designed. Finally, simulation experiments are appropriate to provide for AAR-2 control system by using \emph{Matlab/Simulink}. From the simulation results it can be observed that the designed fuzzy sliding mode controller can control the 6-DOF motion of AAR-2 quickly and precisely. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

  abstract = {This paper presents Soil Property and Object Classification (SPOC), a novel software capability that can visually identify terrain types (e.g., sand, bedrock) as well as terrain features (e.g., scarps, ridges) on a planetary surface. SPOC works on both orbital and ground-bases images. Built upon a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), SPOC employs a machine learning approach, where it learns from a small volume of examples provided by human experts, and applies the learned model to a significant volume of data very efficiently. SPOC is important since terrain type is essential information for evaluating the traversability for rovers, yet manual terrain classification is very labor intensive. This paper presents the technology behind SPOC, as well as two successful applications to Mars rover missions. The first is the landing site traversability analysis for the Mars 2020 Rover (M2020) mission. SPOC identifies 17 terrain classes on full-resolution (25 cm/pixel) HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) images for all eight candidate land-ing sites, each of which spans over 100km\textsuperscript{2}. The other application is slip prediction for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. SPOC processed several thousand NAVCAM (Navigation camera) images taken by the Curiosity rover. Predicted terrain classes were then correlated with observed wheel slip and slope angles to build a slip prediction model. In addition, SPOC was integrated into the MSL downlink pipeline to automatically process all NAVCAM images. These tasks were impractical, if not impossible, to perform manually. SPOC opens the door for big data analysis in planetary exploration. It has a promising potential for a wider range of future applications, such as the automated discovery of scientifically important terrain features on existing Mars orbital imagery, as well as traversability analysis for future surface missions to small bodies and icy worlds. \&copy; 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The five models are: (1) a bland model with 0 or 1 equally likely, (2) a set of order-1 through 8 nonstationary n-gram models, (3) a string matching model for n-grams longer than 8, (4) a nonstationary word unigram and bigram model for English text, and (5) a positional context model for data with fixed length records. Probabilities are weighted roughly by n2/tp(0)p(1) where n is the context length, t is the age of the training data (number of subsequent events), and p(0) and p(1) are the probabilities of a 0 or 1 (favoring long runs of zeros or ones). The aging of training statistics makes the model nonstationary, which gives excellent compression for mixed data types. PAQ1 compresses the concatenated Calgary corpus to 1.824 bits per character, which is 4.5\% better than RK (Taylor, 1999) and 2.9\% better than PPMONSTR (Shkarin, 2001), the top programs rated by Gilchrist (2001) and Ratushnyak (2001) respectively, although those programs do slightly better on homogeneous data.},

  abstract = {Although machine learning holds an enormous promise for autonomous space robots, it is currently not employed because of the inherent uncertain outcome of learning processes. In this article we investigate a learning mechanism, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), which is very reliable and hence an important candidate for real-world deployment even on safety-critical systems such as space robots. To demonstrate this reliability, we introduce a novel SSL setup that allows a stereo vision equipped robot to cope with the failure of one of its cameras. The setup learns to estimate average depth using a monocular image, by using the stereo vision depths from the past as trusted ground truth. We present preliminary results from an experiment on the International Space Station (ISS) performed with the MIT/NASA SPHERES VERTIGO satellite. The presented experiments were performed on October 8th, 2015 on board the ISS. The main goals were (1) data gathering, and (2) navigation based on stereo vision. First the astronaut Kimiya Yui moved the satellite around the Japanese Experiment Module to gather stereo vision data for learning. Subsequently, the satellite freely explored the space in the module based on its (trusted) stereo vision system and a pre-programmed exploration behavior, while simultaneously performing the self-supervised learning of monocular depth estimation on board. The two main goals were successfully achieved, representing the first online learning robotic experiments in space. These results lay the groundwork for a follow-up experiment in which the satellite will use the learned single-camera depth estimation for autonomous exploration in the ISS, and are an advancement towards future space robots that continuously improve their navigation capabilities over time, even in harsh and completely unknown space environments.

It is constructed around the idea of a set in which the membership is a matter of degree rather than yes or no. Though known for more than 30 years, the value of fuzzy logic has been appreciated only recently through applications mainly in consumer appliances in Japan. Fuzzy logic principles have been investigated at Johnson Space Center for several space applications such as translational and rotational control of spacecraft, camera tracking system, auto focusing of microscope, temperature control in a payload module, tether length control and robotics manipulator control. Neural networks known for almost a half-century deal with the complexities of the natural world data by generalizing from prototypes or samples in much the same as humans extrapolate from one experience to similar situations. Neural networks have been studied for fault diagnosis and health monitoring of space operations and have been extended to include time correlated data and create the space-time neural network. Neural networks have been combined with fuzzy logic to investigate the adaptive decision making systems for translational and rotational control. In this paper, the authors describe some of the space applications of fuzzy logic and neural networks including tether skip-rope identification using space time neural network. They also describe the tools developed at Johnson Space Center to support such investigations.},

According to the kinematics transform between the carrier coordinate system and the global coordinate system, the flight trajectory in the global coordinate system is a nonlinear transcendental equation set with quadratic integral. Separate polynomial parameters and other parameters separately, using partial differential Jacobi matrix to express the local linear relationship of the gradients of polynomial parameters and the gradients of other parameters, and Newton-Rap son iterative is used to draw near the real solution.

  abstract = {To accomplish more ambitious scientific goals of interplanetary nanosatellite missions, a certain set of technological challenges need to be addressed to enhance systems performance. An area of particular interest is mission autonomy. Increasing the degree of mission autonomy might help overcoming the limitations imposed by the typical low data rate and the simplified ground segment of small missions. This research aims at supporting the development of more autonomous spacecraft by exploiting the potentialities of artificial intelligence. An artificial neural network is proposed to enable a set of autonomous operations, for example to select what payload data are useful for the mission and must be sent to Earth, and what data can be discarded. The algorithm is developed and tested on a case study represented by a CubeSat mission to a near Earth asteroid that requires the autonomous detection of an impact event on the asteroid surface. The proposed algorithm demonstrates the feasibility of a novel training approach based on optimized datasets created directly in-situ using images taken by the spacecraft on-board camera. The validity of the algorithm is demonstrated through several simulations, considering different scenarios and disturbances. The research presented in this paper can be extended to other applications of the artificial neural networks, such as autonomous failure detection and isolation, also in conjunction with other artificial intelligence approaches.

  abstract = {Adaptive control technology is developed for the inner-loop speed and steering control of the MAX Rover. MAX, a CMU developed Rover, is a compact low-cost 4-wheel drive, 4-wheel steer (double Ackerman), with high-clearance agile durable chassis. It is outfitted with sensors and electronics that make it ideally suited for supporting research relevant to intelligent teleoperation, and as a low-cost autonomous robotic test bed and appliance. The control design consists of a feedback linearization based controller with a proportional-integral (PI) feedback that is augmented by an online adaptive neural network. The adaptation law has guaranteed stability properties for safe operation. The control design is retrofit in nature so that it fits below the outer-loop path planning algorithms. Successful hardware implementation of the controller is illustrated for several scenarios consisting of actuator failures and modeling errors in the nominal design.},

Firstly, with the Lagrangian formulation and the relationship of the system linear momentum conversation, the dynamic equation of system is derived. Based on the above results and the RBF neural network technique, the Ge-Lee (GL) matrix and its product operator, the dynamics of free-floating space manipulator is approximated. And then with all unknown inertial parameters of the manipulator, the adaptive neural network control scheme of coordinated motion between the base's attitude and the manipulator's joints of free-floating space manipulator is developed. It need neither linearly parameterize the dynamic equation of system, nor know any actual inertial parameters. And the neural network need not do training and learning online too. Therefore, the control scheme is prone to real-time application. Lastly, a planar free-floating space manipulator is simulated to verify the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract = {The relation between teaching and research is partly embodied in simple general concepts which can guide the elaboration of examples in both. Notions and constructions, such as the spectral analysis of dynamical systems, have important aspects that can be understood and pursued without the complication of limiting the models to speciﬁc classical categories. Pursuing that idea leads to a dynamical objectiﬁcation of Dedekind reals which is particularly suited to the simple identiﬁcation of metric spaces as enriched categories over a special closed category. Rejecting the complacent description of that identiﬁcation as a mere analogy or amusement, its relentless pursuit [8] is continued, revealing convexity and geodesics as concepts having a deﬁnite meaning over any closed category. Along the way various hopefully enlightening exercises for students (and possible directions for research) are inevitably encountered: (1) an explicit treatment of the contrast between multiplication and divisibility that, in inexorable functorial fashion, mutates into the adjoint relation between autonomous and non-autonomous dynamical systems; (2) the role of commutation relations in the contrast between equilibria and orbits, as well as in qualitative distinctions between extensions of Heyting logic; (3) the functorial contrast between translations and rotations (as appropriately deﬁned) in an arbitrary non symmetric metric space.},

  abstract = {From the Publisher:Among the many approaches to formal reasoning about programs, Dynamic Logic enjoys the singular advantage of being strongly related to classical logic. Its variants constitute natural generalizations and extensions of classical formalisms. For example, Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) can be described as a blend of three complementary classical ingredients: propositional calculus, modal logic, and the algebra of regular events. In First-Order Dynamic Logic (DL), the propositional calculus is replaced by classical first-order predicate calculus. Dynamic Logic is a system of remarkable unity that is theoretically rich as well as of practical value. It can be used for formalizing correctness specifications and proving rigorously that those specifications are met by a particular program. Other uses include determining the equivalence of programs, comparing the expressive power of various programming constructs, and synthesizing programs from specifications.  This book provides the first comprehensive introduction to Dynamic Logic. It is divided into three parts. The first part reviews the appropriate fundamental concepts of logic and computability theory and can stand alone as an introduction to these topics. The second part discusses PDL and its variants, and the third part discusses DL and its variants. Examples are provided throughout, and exercises and a short historical section are included at the end of each chapter.},

For implementation, the tensors are converted into matrices, resulting in compact computer code. The reader can pick FORTRAN templates of missiles, aircraft, or hypersonic vehicles from the complimentary CADAC CD-ROM to jump-start a particular application, and plot the results with CADAC Studio. It is the only textbook that combines the theory of modeling with hands-on examples of three-, five-, and six-DoF simulations. This new and enlarged edition also serves as the anchor for a self-tutoring, three-part course of aerospace simulations in C++, available from AIAA.Amply illustrated with 318 figures and 44 examples, the text can be used for advanced undergraduate and graduate instructions or for self study. Seventy-eight problems and nine projects further develop the material. The second edition contains two new appendices. The original Appendix C, which reviewed state-of-the-art FORTRAN simulations, has been replaced by the description of three self-study CD-ROMs of aerospace simulations in C++. These CDs broaden the applications of this book, moving from simple three-degrees-of-freedom cruise missiles to high fidelity missiles, aircraft, and hypersonic vehicles. The new Appendix D sets forth the theoretical foundation of tensor flight dynamics, and it contains proofs of the rotational time derivative and the Euler transformation.

  abstract = {We present a cognitively-controlled vision system that combines lowlevel object recognition and tracking with high-level symbolic reasoning with the practical purpose of solving difficult space robotics problems—satellite rendezvous and docking. The reasoning module, which encodes a model of the environment, performs deliberation to 1) guide the vision system in a task-directed manner, 2) activate vision modules depending on the progress of the task, 3) validate the performance of the vision system, and 4) suggest corrections to the vision system when the latter is performing poorly. Reasoning and related elements, among them intention, context, and memory, contribute to improve the performance (i.e., robustness, reliability, and usability). We demonstrate the vision system controlling a robotic arm that autonomously captures a free-flying satellite. Currently such operations are performed either manually or by constructing detailed control scripts. The manual approach is costly and exposes the astronauts to danger, while the scripted approach is tedious and error-prone. Therefore, there is substantial interest in performing these operations autonomously, and the work presented here is a step in this direction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only satellite-capturing system that relies exclusively on vision to estimate the pose of the satellite and can deal with an uncooperative satellite.},

Next, the system should be able to detect short-term abnormal and also long-term abnormal behaviors of the elderly people within their normal daily life routine.

  url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/RAST.2009.5158270},
  abstract = {There is growing international interest in a global exploration of the surface of Mars, more distant planets, and planetary moons. Mobile robots are of high interest for unmanned planetary exploration. During the last decade, there has been significant progress toward a supervised autonomous robotic capability for remotely controlled scientific exploration of planetary surfaces. Planetary Micro-Rovers such as Micro-RoSA-2 Mars Rover were designed for autonomous exploration mission in space. The European Space Agency (ESA) also started to develop concepts for micro-rovers for Mars missions. The mission is characterized by limited tele-operation, limited knowledge of the planetary terrain, challenges in obstacle detection and avoidance and hazard detection. Therefore, it requires an accurate obstacle detection and avoidance system which is one of the most critical factors in the design of autonomous vehicles used in such planetary missions. Numerous methods for obstacle avoidance and detection behaviors have been suggested and research in this area of robotics is conducted extensively. Fixed mounting of sonar sensors, rotating sonar sensor, laser scanner and vision based systems are the primary sensors that can be used for the obstacle detection and avoidance behaviors of the mobile robots. With the rapidly improvement of computer technology, Visual-based sensors gain an intense popularity and consequently have been begun to be utilized in so many robotic researches. Among the various applications in robotics, one of the most popular concepts is gathering information from the navigation environments for mobile robots by working on optical flow of vision which is derived from a stereo camera located on the robots. We can determine the optical flow the movement of the objects within the area of robotic vision. If a relative motion in the environment, whether from objects or mobile robot, is present, then the information that can be gathered from this environment is enough for the mobile robot to execute its obstacle detection and avoidance behaviors. Optical flow can be roughly defined as the apparent motion of features in a sequence of images. During navigation, the robot movement is perceived as a relative motion of the field of view, and, in consequence, it gives the impression that static objects and features move respect to the robot. To extract optical flow from a video stream, the direction and magnitude of translational or rotational scene feature movement must be computed at every pair of consecutive camera frames. Optical flow between two consecutive frames is usually represented by a vector for every pixel, where its norm depends on the motion speed and its direction represents the movement of the corresponding pixel in consecutive images. But as the latest researches and techniques have come to view, new practical methods were put forward. In this study, by making use of optical flow calculation and multi layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network, A methodology has been tried to be put forward for mobile robot obstacle detection and avoidance behavior. The study of methodology has been supported by experimental results that were obtained from Matlab simulation environments. The images of the views were taken from the real navigation environment and then optical flow calculations for all images were obtained via matlab simulink blocks that were created in advance, as an algorithm which can calculate optical flows from stereo visions. As optical flows of each pair of stereo views were derived, a data base was constituted in order to train the multi layer perceptron. By the help of data set and Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm, a neural network which was well trained in Matlab environment in order to detect the presence of obstacles was created. Experimental results, obtained during the study have strengthened the ideas which have supported the usage of the Optical Flow via Artificial Neural Network in mobile robotics for obstacle detection and avoidance behaviors.},

  title = {Extended Metacognition for Artificially Intelligent Systems ({{AIS}}): {{Artificial}} Locus of Control and Cognitive Economy},
  volume = {1},
  abstract = {Theories into human learning and cognition have led to much research into new methods and structures for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificially Intelligent Systems (AIS) to learn and reason like humans. As we move toward completely autonomous AIS, the ability to provide metacognitive capabilities becomes important [Crowder and Friess 2011b] in order for the AIS to deal with entirely new situations within the environment it may find itself (e.g., deep space, deep undersea). Presented here are theories and methodologies for Constructivist Learning (CL) processes that provide the methodologies to allow completely autonomous AIS to understand, evaluate, and evolve its "Locus of Control [Watts 2003]." Presented will be the a discussion of how the use of AI learning systems, like Occam [Crowder and Carbone 2011a] and PAC learning can be combined with Cognitive Economy concepts to provide this constructivist learning process to allow a Locus of Control evolution within the AIS. The goal here is to provide the AIS with a fully autonomous, cognitive framework that would be required for autonomous environmental interaction, evolution, and control. In addition, provided are the mathematical constructs, based in Banach Spaces and Lebesque's work in Bounded Variability, that will provide the basis for Cognitive Economy structures in Artificially Intelligent Systems (AIS), allowing the AIS to operate in a "Bounded Rationality" mode, similar to humans, that will allow the autonomous system to function in new, unforeseen, and challenging environments it may find itself in. Natural intelligence filters out irrelevant information (either raw sensory perception information or higher-level conception information), and categorizes the problem representations to allow for maximum information processing with the least cognitive effort. This work is based on the use of Intelligent Software Agents (ISAs) [Crowder 2010a] which will represent the world (its tasks, goals, and information) in terms of the reward values associated with different actions when those features of its abilities are active.},

  abstract = {Because of the limited working hours of astronauts in the space station, the in-cabin robot has high value in the technological validation and scientific research. Based on this requirement, we proposed and designed an Astronaut Assisted Robot(AAR) working in the space station. It can float in the space station cabin, fly autonomously, and hold a fixed position and/or posture. In addition, it also possesses environmental awareness capabilities and intelligence. Thus the AAR can assist astronauts to complete some special scientific experiments or technical tests. In this paper, the system architecture and experimental equipment of the AAR are designed firstly depending on the characteristics of space microgravity environment and the requirements of assisting astronauts missions. And then, the motion principles of the AAR are analyzed and the robot's dynamic model is established by using the Newton - Euler algorithm. Since the attitude control of the robot is the basis for its free movement, the PID Neural Network( PIDNN) algorithm, which is a kind of intelligent control algorithm, is used to design the attitude controller of the AAR. Finally, the reasonability of the robot's structural design and the availability of its attitude controllers are verified through the simulation experiments.},

  abstract = {Language understanding is one of the most important characteristics for human beings. As a pervasive phenomenon in natural language, metaphor is not only an essential thinking approach, but also an ingredient in human conceptual system. Many of our ways of thinking and experiences are virtually represented metaphorically. With the development of the cognitive research on metaphor, it is urgent to formulate a computational model for metaphor understanding based on the cognitive mechanism, especially with the view to promoting natural language understanding. Many works have been done in pragmatics and cognitive linguistics, especially the discussions on metaphor understanding process in pragmatics and metaphor mapping representation in cognitive linguistics. In this paper, a theoretical framework for metaphor understanding based on the embodied mechanism of concept inquiry is proposed. Based on this framework, ontology is introduced as the knowledge representation method in metaphor understanding, and metaphor mapping is formulated as ontology mapping. In line with the conceptual blending theory, a revised conceptual blending framework is presented by adding a lexical ontology and context as the fifth mental space, and a metaphor mapping algorithm is proposed.},

The motivational system provides the motivation that guides the robot operation according to its knowledge of its sensorial space so that rewards are maximized during its lifetime. In order to do this, a motivational engine progressively and interactively creates an internal model of expected future reward (value function) for areas of the robot's state space, through a neuroevolutionary process, over samples obtained in the sensorial (state space) traces followed by the robot whenever it obtained a reward. To improve this modelling process, a strategy is proposed to decompose the global value function leading to the reward or goal into several more local ones, thus discovering sub-goals that simplify the whole learning process and that can be reused in the future. The motivational engine is tested in a simulated experiment with very promising results.},

A PPM model estimates the next-symbol probability distribution by combining statistics from the longest matching contiguous contexts in which each symbol value is found. We introduce a context mixing model which improves on PPM by allowing contexts which are arbitrary functions of the history. Each model independently estimates a probability and confidence that the next bit of data will be 0 or 1. Predictions are combined by weighted averaging. After a bit is arithmetic coded, the weights are adjusted along the cost gradient in weight space to favor the most accurate models. Context mixing compressors, as implemented by the open source PAQ project, are now top ranked on several independent benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Planetary surface science operations performed by robotic space systems frequently require pointing cameras at various objects and moving a robotic arm end effector tool toward specific targets. Earlier NASA Mars Exploration Rovers did not have the ability to compute actual coordinates for given object coordinate frame names and had to be provided with explicit coordinates. Since it sometimes takes hours to more than a day to get final approval of certain calculated coordinates for command uplink via the Earth-based mission operations procedures, a highly desired enhancement for future rovers was to have the onboard automated capability to compute the coordinates for a given frame name. The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover mission is the first to have a centralized coordinate transform database to maintain the knowledge of spatial relations. This onboard intelligence significantly simplifies communication and control between Earth-based human mission operators and the robotic rover on Mars by supporting higher level abstraction of commands using object and target names instead of coordinates. More specifically, the spatial relations of many object frames are represented hierarchically in a tree data structure, called the frame tree. Individual frame transforms are populated by their respective modules that have specific knowledge of the frames. Through this onboard centralized frame tree database, client modules can query transforms between any two frames and support spacecraft commands that use any frames maintained in the frame tree. Various operational examples in the MSL mission that have greatly benefitted from this onboard centralized frame tree database are presented.},

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require sophisticated hand- tuned models, but rather learns the policy online, which makes the system easily adaptable to changing conditions. The blimp we apply our approach to is a small-scale vehicle equipped with an ultrasound sensor that measures its elevation relative to the ground. The major problem in the context of learning control policies lies in the high-dimensional state-action space that needs to be explored in order to identify the values of all state-action pairs. In this paper, we propose a solution to learning continuous control policies based on the Gaussian process model. In practical experiments carried out on a real robot we demonstrate that the system is able to learn a policy online within a few minutes only.},

  abstract = {A today's trend within the aircraft industry is towards a so-called More Electric Aircraft (MEA) architecture, using electric power as single type of energy to supply most of the systems on board of an air vehicle. Besides the various advantages, e.g. improved efficiency, reduced operating costs, etc., this will increase the complexity of the electrical system and therefore have an impact on the related Control and Monitoring System. Making use of new opportunities such as an efficient power management will even further increase the complexity of system management. Additional requirements regarding decision making and communication arise when used on board of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs). The concept of cognitive automation and the Cognitive System Architecture developed on the Munich University of the Armed Forces (UBM) is well suited to address many of these challenges. In this paper we investigate the application of Cognitive Automation for an advanced power management within a MEA architecture. After the system related aspects of the new MEA architecture are presented, the theory of Cognitive Automation is briefly introduced. The method to achieve a centralised knowledge representation for the General Systems domain is presented and two different approaches to planning within this framework are discussed. Both approaches were implemented and verified using a simulation model of the general systems.},

The robot control system consists of an artificial neural network trained using evolutionary computation techniques. An adaptive threshold on the infrared sensors has been evolved together with the neural control system to allow the robot to adapt itself to many different environmental conditions. The properties of the behavior obtained after the evolutionary process has been tested by measuring the generalization performance of the rover under various terrain conditions and especially under rough terrain conditions. In addition, the dynamics of the co-evolution between the controller and the threshold has been analyzed. Those analyses show that different pathways have been explored by the evolutionary process in order to adapt the sensing abilities and the control system.},

  abstract = {Autonomous control systems onboard planetary rovers and spacecraft benefit from having cognitive capabilities like learning so that they can adapt to unexpected situations in-situ. Q-learning is a form of reinforcement learning and it has been efficient in solving certain class of learning problems. However, embedded systems onboard planetary rovers and spacecraft rarely implement learning algorithms due to the constraints faced in the field, like processing power, chip size, convergence rate and costs due to the need for radiation hardening. These challenges present a compelling need for a portable, low-power, area efficient hardware accelerator to make learning algorithms practical onboard space hardware. This paper presents a FPGA implementation of Q-learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This method matches the massive parallelism inherent in neural network software with the fine-grain parallelism of an FPGA hardware thereby dramatically reducing processing time. Mars Science Laboratory currently uses Xilinx-Space-grade Virtex FPGA devices for image processing, pyrotechnic operation control and obstacle avoidance. We simulate and program our architecture on a Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA. The architectural implementation for a single neuron Q-learning and a more complex Multilayer Perception (MLP) Q-learning accelerator has been demonstrated. The results show up to a 43-fold speed up by Virtex 7 FPGAs compared to a conventional Intel i5 2.3 GHz CPU. Finally, we simulate the proposed architecture using the Symphony simulator and compiler from Xilinx, and evaluate the performance and power consumption.},

Recently, however, cognitive scientists and philosophers studying "embodied" or "situated" cognition have begun emphasizing the role of the body and environment in which brains are situated, i.e. they view the brain as an "open system". However, these theorists frequently rely on dynamical systems which are traditionally viewed as closed systems. We address this tension by extending the framework of dynamical systems theory. We show how structures which appear in the state space of an embodied agent differ from those that appear in closed systems, and we show how these structures can be used to model representational processes in embodied agents.

  abstract = {As technology allows the growth in size and performance of spacecraft their control systems are continuously redesigned to achieve improvements in accuracy and stabilization. A clear line in research is the improvement in the design and development of sensors and actuators to became smaller, more precise and cheap. The research line in intelligent control leads to the development of new control strategies based on new ideas and principles. The goal of the paper is to describe the undergoing European projects to develop and achieve a fuzzy logic based technology for the control of a spacecraft. In the search for an easy, efficient, cost-effective control design and development technique, fuzzy logic seems to provide a method of reducing system complexity while increasing control performance. First, the article analyses which the current techniques in spacecraft control systems. The emphasis is put on the analyses and design of spacecraft control systems due to its complexity. Second, the article discusses in detail if fuzzy logic can be applied to spacecraft control systems and how can this be done easily and efficiently. Two different techniques are detailed: direct control and supervisory control. The advantage and disadvantages of each of them are carefully described. Next, the paper details the available systems in Europe at this moment. The focus is centered around the efforts made by ESA to build three different models of spacecraft control systems based on fuzzy logic: 3-axis stabilized spacecraft model, rendezvous and docking model, and re-entry model. After that, the paper concludes with the efforts to develop a proprietary technology to cover the existing gap in Europe. Fuzzy Logic may lead the path to new fast, robust, extensible, upgradable, and much cheaper spacecraft control systems.},

  abstract = {A critical requirement for safe autonomous navigation of a planetary rover is the ability to accurately estimate the traversability of the terrain. This work considers the problem of predicting the attitude and configuration angles of the platform from terrain representations that are often incomplete due to occlusions and sensor limitations. Using Gaussian Processes (GP) and exteroceptive data as training input, we can provide a continuous and complete representation of terrain traversability, with uncertainty in the output estimates. In this paper, we propose a novel method that focuses on exploiting the explicit correlation in vehicle attitude and configuration during operation by learning a kernel function from vehicle experience to perform GP regression. We provide an extensive experimental validation of the proposed method on a planetary rover. We show significant improvement in the accuracy of our estimation compared with results obtained using standard kernels (Squared Exponential and Neural Network), and compared to traversability estimation made over terrain models built using state-of-the-art GP techniques.},

  abstract = {Robotic space-exploration missions have always pushed the limits of science and technology, and will continue to do so by their very nature. Such missions are particularly challenging, as they operate in environments with high uncertainty, light-time delays, and high mission costs. Artificial-intelligence-based multiagent systems can alleviate these concerns by 1) creating autonomous multirobot teams that can function in uncertain environments, 2) navigating and operating without time-sensitive commands from Earth-bound scientists, and 3) spreading the mission cost across multiple platforms that will eliminate the danger of total mission loss in the case of a malfunctioning robot. In this work, a novel human in-the-loop cooperative coevolutionary algorithm is presented to train a multirobot system exploring an unknown environment. Autonomous robots learn to make low-level control decisions to maximize scientific data acquisition, whereas human scientists on Earth learn the changing mission profiles and provide high-level objectives to the robots. Results demonstrate that the algorithm reduces the number of robots needed for a particular performance level tenfold compared to traditional cooperative coevolutionary algorithms for configurations of 10 or more rovers, resulting in significantly lower mission costs. Further, the trained multirobot system is extremely robust to noise, and 10\% sensor and actuator noise (with and without sensor bias) has no statistically significant impact on system performance. Finally, the system is extremely robust to robot failures; for any percentage of robot failures between 10 and 90\%, the percentage loss in performance is less than the percentage of failed robots.},

With all uncertain inertial system parameters, an adaptive RBF neural network control scheme is developed for coordinated motion between the base attitude and the arm joints.

Firstly, we argue that the symbol grounding problems as well as the "situatedness" problems should be the consequences of lacking a shared metric space for the interactions between the higher cognitive levels based on symbol systems and the lower sensory-motor levels based on analog dynamical systems. In our prior studies it was proposed to employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as adaptive dynamical systems for implementing the top-down cognitive processes by which it is expected that dense interactions can be made between the cognitive and the sensory-motor levels. Our mobile robot experiments in prior works showed that the acquired internal models embedded in the RNN is naturally situated to the physical environment by means of entrainment between the RNN and the environmental dynamics. In the current study, further analysis was conducted on the dynamical structures obtained in the experiments, which turned out to clarify the essential differences between the conventional symbol systems and its equivalence realized in the adaptive dynamical systems.},

  abstract = {Autonomous agents that learn from reward on highdimensional visual observations must learn to simplify the raw observations in both space (i.e., dimensionality reduction) and time (i.e., prediction), so that reinforcement learning becomes tractable and effective. Training the spatial and temporal models requires an appropriate sampling scheme, which cannot be hardcoded if the algorithm is to be general. Intrinsic rewards are associated with samples that best improve the agent’s model of the world. Yet the dynamic nature of an intrinsic reward signal presents a major obstacle to successfully realizing an efﬁcient curiosity-drive. TD-based incremental reinforcement learning approaches fail to adapt quickly enough to effectively exploit the curiosity signal. In this paper, a novel artiﬁcial curiosity system with planning is implemented, based on developmental or continual learning principles. Least-squares policy iteration is used with an agent’s internal forward model, to efﬁciently assign values for maximizing combined external and intrinsic reward. The properties of this system are illustrated in a highdimensional, noisy, visual environment that requires the agent to explore. With no useful external value information early on, the self-generated intrinsic values lead to actions that improve both its spatial (perceptual) and temporal (cognitive) models. Curiosity also leads it to learn how it could act to maximize external reward.},

The robot model has successfully performed the automatic truss structure assembly, including many jobs, e.g., manipulator berthing, component manipulation, arm trajectory control collision avoidance, assembly using force control, etc. Moreover, even if the robot fails in a task planned in advance, the robot re-plans the task by using reinforcement learning, and obtains the task goal for basically kinematic problems. But, for a class of complicated dynamic problems, the computational periods and efforts are infeasible for on-line learning. Some approaches are proposed to accelerate the learning speed, which also give models of cognitive actions and approaches to so-called a frame problem.

Embodied agents usually function in a dynamic, uncertain, and uncontrolled environment, and exploiting them is a chaotic and error-prone task which demands high-level behavioral controllers to be able to adapt to failure at lower levels of the system. The conditions in which space robotic systems such as spacecraft and rovers operate, inspire by necessity, the development of robust and adaptive control software. In this paper, we propose a generic architecture for migrating and autonomous agents inspired by onboard autonomy which enables the developers to tailor the agent's embodiment by defining a set of feasible actions and perceptions associated with the new body. Evaluation results suggest that the architecture supports migration by performing consistent deliberative and reactive behaviors.},

  title = {Intelligent {{Perception}} in {{Virtual Sensor Networks}} and {{Space Robotics}}},
  abstract = {Intelligent perception is a fundamental requirement of systems that exhibit sophisticated
autonomous operation in complex dynamic worlds. It combines low-level, bottom-up, datadriven
vision with high-level, top-down, knowledge-based processes. This thesis develops
two embodied, task-oriented vision systems that exhibit autonomous, intelligent, goal-driven
behavior through intelligent perception.
In Part I of the thesis, we develop a prototype surveillance system featuring a visual sensor
network comprising wide field-of-view (FOV) passive cameras and pan/tilt/zoom active
cameras. Novel multicamera control strategies enable the camera nodes to collaborate both in
tracking pedestrians of interest that move across the FOVs of different cameras and in acquiring
close-up videos of pedestrians as they travel across extended areas. Impediments to deploying
and experimenting with appropriately extensive camera networks in large, busy public spaces
would make our research more or less infeasible in the real world. However, a unique centerpiece
of our approach is the virtual vision paradigm, in which we employ a visually and
behaviorally realistic simulator in the design and evaluation of our surveillance systems. In
particular, we employ a virtual train station populated by autonomous, lifelike virtual pedestrians,
wherein easily reconfigurable virtual cameras generate synthetic video feeds that emulate
those acquired by real surveillance cameras monitoring public spaces.
In Part II of the thesis, we develop a cognitively-controlled vision system that combines
ii
low-level object recognition and tracking with high-level symbolic reasoning to tackle difficult
space robotics problems, specifically satellite rendezvous and docking. There is significant
interest in performing these operations autonomously, and our work is a step in this direction.
Reasoning and related elements, among them intention, context, and memory, contribute to
improve performance. We demonstrate the vision system controlling a robotic arm that autonomously
captures a free-flying satellite. To date, this is the only satellite-capturing system
that relies exclusively on vision to estimate the pose of the satellite and can deal with an uncooperative
satellite.},

We develop a rover-type space probe, which has a stabilizer with two movable joints like an arm, and learns how to use them by employing EGA. To evaluate the effectiveness of the recovery system based on the EGA, the following two field experiments are conducted with the proposed rover: (i) a small field test, including a stuck area created artificially in a park; and (ii) a large field test, including several stuck areas in Black Rock Desert, USA, as an analog experiment for planetary exploration. The experimental results reveal the following implications: (1) the recovery system based on the EGA enables our rover to exit stuck areas by an appropriate sequence of motions of the two movable joints; and (2) the success rate of getting out of stuck areas is 95\% during planetary exploration. \&copy; 2017, Fuji Technology Press.

  abstract = {When both the attitude and location of base were uncontrolled, the control for free-floating space manipulator to track desired trajectory in joint space was discussed. Combining the relationship of the linear and angular momentum conversation of the system and the Lagrange approach, the full-controlled dynamic equation of free-floating space manipulator was established. Based on above results proposed, aiming at the case of free-floating space manipulator system with uncertain inertial parameters, a composite scheme of a computed torque controller plus a fuzzy compensator was proposed to track desired trajectories in joint space. Namely, it made up impact of system s unknown parameters to computed torque controller through fuzzy adaptive compensation system controller, to ensure the whole closed-loop control system's asymptotic stability with the existence of unknown parameters. The mentioned control scheme could effectively control two joint of space manipulator to stably track the desired trajectory in joint space, which had obvious advantages that it was necessary to feedback and measure the position, velocity, acceleration, attitude angle velocity and attitude angle acceleration of the floating base, at the same time, no any requirements for the dynamic equations of the system were linearly dependent on inertial parameters. A two space-based manipulator system was simulated to verify the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract = {Intentional behavior is a basic property of intelligence, and it incorporates the cyclic operation of prediction, testing by action, sensing, perceiving and assimilating the experienced features. Intentional neurodynamic principles are applied for on-line processing of multisensory inputs and for the generation of dynamic behavior using the SRR (Sample Return Rover) platform at the indoor facility of the planetary robotics laboratory, jet propulsion laboratory. The studied sensory modalities include CMOS camera vision, orientation based on an internal motion unit and accelerometer signals. The control architecture employs a biologically inspired dynamic neural network operating on the principle of chaotic neural dynamics manifesting intentionality in the style of mammalian brains. Learning is based on Hebbian rules coupled with reinforcement. The central issue of this work is to study how the developed control system builds associations between the sensory modalities to achieve robust autonomous action selection. The proposed system builds such associations in a self-organized way and it is called self-organized development of autonomous adaptive systems (SODAS). This system operates autonomously, without the need for human intervention, which is a potentially very beneficial feature in challenging environments, such as encountered in space explorations at remote planetary environments. The experiments illustrate obstacle avoidance combined with goal-oriented navigation by the SRR robot using SODAS control principles.},

The control schemes proposed don't require the measurements and feedback of the position, linear velocity and acceleration of the base. Besides, compared with traditional adaptive control schemes, they can avoid linearly parameterizing the dynamic equations of the system and subsequently reduce tedious computations during the determination of the regression matrix for the system.

It must reason about which conflict to resolve first and what repair method to try for the given conflict. ASPEN is currently being utilized in the development of automated planner/scheduler systems for several spacecraft, including the UFO-1 naval communications satellite and the Citizen Explorer (CX1) satellite, as well as for planetary rover operations and antenna ground systems automation. The paper focuses on the algorithm and search strategies employed by ASPEN to resolve spacecraft operations constraints, as well as the data structures for representing these constraints.},

  abstract = {Future science-driven landing missions, conceived to collect in situ data on regions of planetary bodies that have the highest potential to yield important scientific discoveries, will require a higher degree of autonomy. The latter includes the ability of the spacecraft to autonomously select the landing site using real-time data acquired during the descent phase. This paper presents the development of an Evolutionary Fuzzy Cognitive Map (E-FCM) model that implements an artificial intelligence system capable of autonomously selecting a landing site with the highest potential for scientific discoveries constrained by the requirement of soft landing in a region with safe terrains. The proposed E-FCM evolves its internal states and interconnections as a function of real-time data collected during the descent phase, therefore improving the decision process as more accurate information becomes available. The E-FCM is constructed using knowledge accumulated by planetary experts and it is tested on scenarios that simulate the decision process during the descent phase toward the Hyndla Regio on Venus. The E-FCM is shown to quickly reach conclusions that are consistent with what would be the choice of a planetary expert if the scientist were presented with the same information. The proposed methodology is fast and efficient and may be suitable for on-board spacecraft implementation and real-time decision making during the course of robotic exploration of the Solar System.

In a computational framework, the notion of a pattern can be formalized as a program that uses regularities in observations to store them in a compact form, called a compressor. The search for interesting patterns can then be stated as a search to better compress the history of observations. This paper introduces coherence progress, a novel, general measure of interestingness that is independent of its use in a particular agent and the ability of the compressor to learn from observations. Coherence progress considers the increase in coherence obtained by any compressor when adding an observation to the history of observations thus far. Because of its applicability to any type of compressor, the measure allows for an easy, quick, and domain-speciﬁc implementation. We demonstrate the capability of coherence progress to satisfy the requirements for qualitatively measuring interestingness on a Wikipedia dataset.},

While we believe the field has achieved a remarkable success, we claim that there is a wide window for improvement. The field of machine learning has an abundance of methods that promise solutions to some aspects of PCG that are still under-researched. In this paper, we advocate the use of Intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning for content generation. A class of methods that thrive for knowledge for its own sake rather than as a step towards finding a solution. We argue that this approach promises solutions to some of the well-known problems in PCG: (1) searching for novelty and diversity can be easily incorporated as an intrinsic reward, (2) improving models of player experience and generation of adapted content can be done simultaneously through combining extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, and (3) mix-initiative design tools can incorporate more knowledge about the designer and her preferences and ultimately provide better assistance. We demonstrate our arguments and discuss the challenges that face the proposed approach.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05380},
  abstract = {We consider the exploration/exploitation problem in reinforcement learning. For exploitation, it is well known that the Bellman equation connects the value at any time-step to the expected value at subsequent time-steps. In this paper we consider a similar uncertainty Bellman equation (UBE), which connects the uncertainty at any time-step to the expected uncertainties at subsequent time-steps, thereby extending the potential exploratory benefit of a policy beyond individual time-steps. We prove that the unique fixed point of the UBE yields an upper bound on the variance of the estimated value of any fixed policy. This bound can be much tighter than traditional count-based bonuses that compound standard deviation rather than variance. Importantly, and unlike several existing approaches to optimism, this method scales naturally to large systems with complex generalization. Substituting our UBE-exploration strategy for \$$\backslash$epsilon\$-greedy improves DQN performance on 51 out of 57 games in the Atari suite.},

  abstract = {Information theory is a powerful tool to express principles to drive autonomous systems because it is domain invariant and allows for an intuitive interpretation. This paper studies the use of the predictive information (PI), also called excess entropy or effective measure complexity, of the sensorimotor process as a driving force to generate behavior. We study nonlinear and nonstationary systems and introduce the time-local predicting information (TiPI) which allows us to derive exact results together with explicit update rules for the parameters of the controller in the dynamical systems framework. In this way the information principle, formulated at the level of behavior, is translated to the dynamics of the synapses. We underpin our results with a number of case studies with high-dimensional robotic systems. We show the spontaneous cooperativity in a complex physical system with decentralized control. Moreover, a jointly controlled humanoid robot develops a high behavioral variety depending on its physics and the environment it is dynamically embedded into. The behavior can be decomposed into a succession of low-dimensional modes that increasingly explore the behavior space. This is a promising way to avoid the curse of dimensionality which hinders learning systems to scale well.},

  abstract = {Psychologists distinguish between extrinsically motivated behavior, which is behavior undertaken to achieve some externally supplied reward, such as a prize, a high grade, or a high-paying job, and intrinsically motivated behavior, which is behavior done for its own sake. Is an analogous distinction meaningful for machine learning systems? Can we say of a machine learning system that it is motivated to learn, and if so, is it possible to provide it with an analog of intrinsic motivation? Despite the fact that a formal distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is elusive, this chapter argues that the answer to both questions is assuredly “yes” and that the machine learning framework of reinforcement learning is particularly appropriate for bringing learning together with what in animals one would call motivation. Despite the common perception that a reinforcement learning agent’s reward has to be extrinsic because the agent has a distinct input channel for reward signals, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for incorporating principles of intrinsic motivation.},

  abstract = {In recent years, information theory has come into the focus of researchers interested in the sensorimotor dynamics of both robots and living beings. One root for these approaches is the idea that living beings are information processing systems and that the optimization of these processes should be an evolutionary advantage. Apart from these more fundamental questions, there is much interest recently in the question how a robot can be equipped with an internal drive for innovation or curiosity that may serve as a drive for an open-ended, self-determined development of the robot. The success of these approaches depends essentially on the choice of a convenient measure for the information. This article studies in some detail the use of the predictive information (PI), also called excess entropy or effective measure complexity, of the sensorimotor process. The PI of a process quantifies the total information of past experience that can be used for predicting future events. However, the application of information theoretic measures in robotics mostly is restricted to the case of a finite, discrete state-action space. This article aims at applying the PI in the dynamical systems approach to robot control. We study linear systems as a first step and derive exact results for the PI together with explicit learning rules for the parameters of the controller. Interestingly, these learning rules are of Hebbian nature and local in the sense that the synaptic update is given by the product of activities available directly at the pertinent synaptic ports. The general findings are exemplified by a number of case studies. In particular, in a two-dimensional system, designed at mimicking embodied systems with latent oscillatory locomotion patterns, it is shown that maximizing the PI means to recognize and amplify the latent modes of the robotic system. This and many other examples show that the learning rules derived from the maximum PI principle are a versatile tool for the self-organization of behavior in complex robotic systems.},

A value system permits a biological brain to increase the likelihood of neural responses to selected external phenomena. Many machine learning algorithms capture the essence of this learning process. However, computational value systems aim not only to support learning, but also autonomous attention focus to direct learning. This combination of unsupervised attention focus and learning aims to address the grand challenge of autonomous mental development for machines. This survey examines existing value systems for developmental cognitive robotics in this context. We examine the definitions of value used—including recent pioneering work in intrinsic motivation as value—as well as initialisation strategies for innate values, update strategies for acquired value and the data structures used for storing value. We examine the extent to which existing value systems support attention focus, learning and prediction in an unsupervised setting. The types of robots and applications in which these value systems are used are also examined, as well as the ways that these applications are evaluated. Finally, we study the strengths and limitations of current value systems for developmental cognitive robots and conclude with a set of research challenges for this field.},

  abstract = {What are the functions of curiosity? What are the mechanisms of curiosity-driven learning? We approach these questions using concepts and tools from machine learning and developmental robotics. We argue that curiosity-driven learning enables organisms to make discoveries to solve complex problems with rare or deceptive rewards. By fostering exploration and discovery of a diversity of behavioural skills, and ignoring these rewards, curiosity can be efficient to bootstrap learning when there is no information, or deceptive information, about local improvement towards these problems. We review both normative and heuristic computational frameworks used to understand the mechanisms of curiosity in humans, conceptualizing the child as a sense-making organism. These frameworks enable us to discuss the bi-directional causal links between curiosity and learning, and to provide new hypotheses about the fundamental role of curiosity in self-organizing developmental structures through curriculum learning. We present various developmental robotics experiments that study these mechanisms in action, both supporting these hypotheses and opening new research avenues in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Finally, we discuss challenges for the design of experimental paradigms for studying curiosity in psychology and cognitive neuroscience.},

  abstract = {In the first simulation, the intrinsic motivation of the agent was given by measuring learning progress through reduction in informational surprise (Figure 1 A-C). This way the agent should first learn the action that is easiest to learn (a1), and then switch to other actions that still allow for learning (a2) and ignore actions that cannot be learned at all (a3). This is exactly what we found in our simple environment. Compared to the original developmental learning algorithm based on learning progress proposed by Oudeyer [2], our Context Tree Weighting approach does not require local experts to do prediction, rather it learns the conditional probability distribution over observations given action in one structure. In the second simulation, the intrinsic motivation of the agent was given by measuring compression progress through improvement in compressibility (Figure 1 D-F). The agent behaves similarly: the agent first concentrates on the action with the most predictable consequence and then switches over to the regular action where the consequence is more difficult to predict, but still learnable. Unlike the previous simulation, random actions are also interesting to some extent because the compressed symbol strings use 8-bit representations, while only 2 bits are required for our observation space. Our preliminary results suggest that Context Tree Weighting might provide a useful representation to study problems of development.},

  shorttitle = {Artificial General Intelligence through Recursive Data Compression and Grounded Reasoning},
  abstract = {This paper presents a tentative outline for the construction of an artificial, generally intelligent system (AGI). It is argued that building a general data compression algorithm solving all problems up to a complexity threshold should be the main thrust of research. A measure for partial progress in AGI is suggested. Although the details are far from being clear, some general properties for a general compression algorithm are fleshed out. Its inductive bias should be flexible and adapt to the input data while constantly searching for a simple, orthogonal and complete set of hypotheses explaining the data. It should recursively reduce the size of its representations thereby compressing the data increasingly at every iteration. Abstract Based on that fundamental ability, a grounded reasoning system is proposed. It is argued how grounding and flexible feature bases made of hypotheses allow for resourceful thinking. While the simulation of representation contents on the mental stage accounts for much of the power of propositional logic, compression leads to simple sets of hypotheses that allow the detection and verification of universally quantified statements. Abstract Together, it is highlighted how general compression and grounded reasoning could account for the birth and growth of first concepts about the world and the commonsense reasoning about them.},

In most of this book we will ignore these other current and historical efforts except where they are directly useful for CogPrime—there are many literature reviews already published, and this is a research treatise not a textbook. In this chapter, however, we will break from this pattern and give a rough high-level overview of the various AGI architectures at play in the field today. The overview definitely has a bias toward other work with some direct relevance to CogPrime, but not an overwhelming bias; we also discuss a number of approaches that are unrelated to, and even in some cases conceptually orthogonal to, our own.},

Real-world general intelligence is about intelligence relative to some particular class of environments, and human-like general intelligence is about intelligence relative to the particular class of environments that humans evolved in (which in recent millennia has included environments humans have created using their intelligence). In Chap. 4, we reviewed some specific capabilities characterizing human-like general intelligence; to connect these with the general theory of general intelligence from the last few chapters, we need to explain what aspects of human-relevant environments correspond to these human-like intelligent capabilities. We begin with aspects of the environment related to communication, which turn out to tie in closely with cognitive synergy. Then we turn to physical aspects of the environment, which we suspect also connect closely with various human cognitive capabilities. Finally we turn to physical aspects of the human body and their relevance to the human mind. In the following chapter we present a deeper, more abstract theoretical framework encompassing these ideas.},

A collection of patterns is thus a pattern-network. Knowledge of all kinds may be given network representations; and cognitive processes may be represented as networks also; for instance via representing them as programs, which may be represented as trees or graphs in various standard ways. The emergent patterns arising in an intelligence as it develops may be viewed as a pattern network in themselves; and the relations between an embodied mind and its physical and social environment may be viewed in terms of ecological and social networks.},

The advantages of this platform are presented within the scope of three AI research problems: (1) motion execution in a complex 3D world; (2) learning how to play a computer game based on reward and punishment; and (3) learning hierarchies of goals. Although there are no theoretical novelties in (1,2,3), our goal is to show with these experiments that the proposed platform is not just another ANN simulator. This framework instead aims to provide the ability to test proactive and heterogeneous modular systems in a closed-loop with the environment. Furthermore, it enables the rapid prototyping, testing, and sharing of new AI architectures, or their parts.},

  abstract = {This thesis contributes to the formalisation of the notion of an agent within the class of finite multivariate Markov chains. Agents are seen as entities that act, perceive, and are goal-directed. We present a new measure that can be used to identify entities (called \$$\backslash$iota\$-entities), some general requirements for entities in multivariate Markov chains, as well as formal definitions of actions and perceptions suitable for such entities. The intuition behind \$$\backslash$iota\$-entities is that entities are spatiotemporal patterns for which every part makes every other part more probable. The measure, complete local integration (CLI), is formally investigated in general Bayesian networks. It is based on the specific local integration (SLI) which is measured with respect to a partition. CLI is the minimum value of SLI over all partitions. We prove that \$$\backslash$iota\$-entities are blocks in specific partitions of the global trajectory. These partitions are the finest partitions that achieve a given SLI value. We also establish the transformation behaviour of SLI under permutations of nodes in the network. We go on to present three conditions on general definitions of entities. These are not fulfilled by sets of random variables i.e.$\backslash$ the perception-action loop, which is often used to model agents, is too restrictive. We propose that any general entity definition should in effect specify a subset (called an an entity-set) of the set of all spatiotemporal patterns of a given multivariate Markov chain. The set of \$$\backslash$iota\$-entities is such a set. Importantly the perception-action loop also induces an entity-set. We then propose formal definitions of actions and perceptions for arbitrary entity-sets. These specialise to standard notions in case of the perception-action loop entity-set. Finally we look at some very simple examples.},

This position paper aims to make a small conceptual contribution toward reaching that starting line.

  abstract = {Artiﬁcial General Intelligence (AGI) is a ﬁeld of research aiming to distill the principles of intelligence that operate independently of a speciﬁc problem domain or a predeﬁned context and utilize these principles in order to synthesize systems capable of performing any intellectual task a human being is capable of and eventually go beyond that. While “narrow” artiﬁcial intelligence that focuses on solving speciﬁc problems such as speech recognition, text comprehension, visual pattern recognition, robotic motion, etc. has shown quite a few impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding general intelligence remains elusive. In this paper we oﬀer a novel theoretical approach to understanding general intelligence. We start with a brief introduction of the current conceptual approach. Our critique exposes a number of serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the concept of intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from intelligence perceived as a competence of individual agents deﬁned in relation to an a priori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative process of self-organization by which intelligent agents are individuated. We call this process open-ended intelligence. This paradigmatic shift signiﬁcantly extends the concept of intelligence beyond its current conventional deﬁnitions and overcomes the diﬃculties exposed in the critique. Open-ended intelligence is developed as an abstraction of the process of cognitive development so its application can be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three facets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making – the bringing forth of a world of objects and relations, and the individuation of general cognitive agents in the light of the enactive approach to cognition and assemblage theory. We study these in order to establish in what sense formative individuating processes are indeed intelligent and why they are open-ended. We further show how open-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed, self-organizing network of interacting elements (i.e. a complex adaptive system) and how such a process is scalable. The framework highlights an important relation between coordination and intelligence and a new understanding of values. We conclude with a number of questions for future research.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04361},
  abstract = {"Cognitive synergy" refers to a dynamic in which multiple cognitive processes, cooperating to control the same cognitive system, assist each other in overcoming bottlenecks encountered during their internal processing. Cognitive synergy has been posited as a key feature of real-world general intelligence, and has been used explicitly in the design of the OpenCog cognitive architecture. Here category theory and related concepts are used to give a formalization of the cognitive synergy concept. A series of formal models of intelligent agents is proposed, with increasing specificity and complexity: simple reinforcement learning agents; "cognit" agents with an abstract memory and processing model; hypergraph-based agents (in which "cognit" operations are carried out via hypergraphs); hypergraph agents with a rich language of nodes and hyperlinks (such as the OpenCog framework provides); "PGMC" agents whose rich hypergraphs are endowed with cognitive processes guided via Probabilistic Growth and Mining of Combinations; and finally variations of the PrimeAGI design, which is currently being built on top of OpenCog. A notion of cognitive synergy is developed for cognitive processes acting within PGMC agents, based on developing a formal notion of "stuckness," and defining synergy as a relationship between cognitive processes in which they can help each other out when they get stuck. It is proposed that cognitive processes relating to each other synergetically, associate in a certain way with functors that map into each other via natural transformations. Cognitive synergy is proposed to correspond to a certain inequality regarding the relative costs of different paths through certain commutation diagrams.

This paper offers a consolidated presentation of a theory of bounded rationality based on information-theoretic ideas. We provide a conceptual justification for using the free energy functional as the objective function for characterizing bounded-rational decisions. This functional possesses three crucial properties: it controls the size of the solution space; it has Monte Carlo planners that are exact, yet bypass the need for exhaustive search; and it captures model uncertainty arising from lack of evidence or from interacting with other agents having unknown intentions. We discuss the single-step decision-making case, and show how to extend it to sequential decisions using equivalence transformations. This extension yields a very general class of decision problems that encompass classical decision rules (e.g. EXPECTIMAX and MINIMAX) as limit cases, as well as trust- and risk-sensitive planning.},

Traditional compression algorithms typically operate on individual bytes. While this approach works well for the single-byte ASCII encoding, it works poorly for UTF-8, where characters often span multiple bytes. Previous research has focused on developing Unicode compressors from scratch, which often failed to outperform established algorithms such as bzip2. We develop a technique to Unicode compressors to operate directly on Unicode characters, and implement variants of LZW and PPM that apply this technique. We find that our method substantially improves compression effectiveness on a UTF-8 corpus. On ASCII and binary files, our variants perform similarly to the original unmodified compressors.},

We introduce cognitive categories, which are categories with exactly one morphism between any two objects. Objects in these categories are interpreted as states and morphisms as transformations between states. Moreover, cognitive problems are reduced to the specification of two objects in a cognitive category: an outset (i.e. the current state of the system) and a goal (i.e. the desired state). Cognitive systems transform the target system by means of generators and evaluators. Generators realize cognitive operations over a system by grouping morphisms, whilst evaluators group objects as a way to generalize outsets and goals to partially defined states. Meta-cognition emerges when the whole cognitive system is self-referenced as sub-states in the cognitive category, whilst learning must always be considered as a meta-cognitive process to maintain consistency. Several examples grounded in basic AI methods are provided as well.},

Recently proposed methods can learn variable-order Markov models of the underlying process but have steep memory requirements and are sensitive to aliasing between observation histories due to sensor noise. This paper proposes dynamic-depth context tree weighting (D2-CTW), a model-learning method that addresses these limitations. D2-CTW dynamically expands a sufﬁx tree while ensuring that the size of the model, but not its depth, remains bounded. We show that D2-CTW approximately matches the performance of state-of-the-art alternatives at stochastic time-series prediction while using at least an order of magnitude less memory. We also apply D2-CTW to model-based RL, showing that, on tasks that require memory of past observations, D2-CTW can learn without prior knowledge of a good state representation, or even the length of history upon which such a representation should depend.},

We consider three fundamentally different models, all too limited to perfectly model the dynamics of the system. Remarkably, we ﬁnd that our technique provides sufﬁciently accurate value estimates for effective on-policy control.

As illustration, we describe the learning process by which O learns elementary arithmetic. In the beginning, O knows nothing about the syntax or laws of arithmetic; by the end, it has constructed a theory enabling it to solve previously unseen problems such as “what is 67 ∗ 8?” and “which number comes next in the sequence 8, 11, 14?”.},

One promising approach has been to decompose the model learning task into a number of smaller, more manageable sub-problems by factoring the observation space. Typically, many diﬀerent factorizations are possible, which can make it diﬃcult to select an appropriate factorization without extensive testing. In this paper we introduce the class of recursively decomposable factorizations, and show how exact Bayesian inference can be used to eﬃciently guarantee predictive performance close to the best factorization in this class.

Surprise quantiﬁes how data affects a natural or artiﬁcial observer, by measuring the difference between posterior and prior beliefs of the observer. Using this framework we measure the extent to which humans direct their gaze towards surprising items while watching television and video games. We ﬁnd that subjects are strongly attracted towards surprising locations, with 72\% of all human gaze shifts directed towards locations more surprising than the average, a ﬁgure which rises to 84\% when considering only gaze targets simultaneously selected by all subjects. The resulting theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.},

The other is a fully-supervised semantic segmentation approach with efﬁcient dataset collection. We conduct an extensive analysis of the two methods on our ARC 2017 dataset.

Existing approaches rely on various local heuristics for enforcing the acyclicity constraint and are not well-suited to general purpose optimization packages for their solution. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different strategy: We formulate the structure learning problem as a smooth, constrained optimization problem over real matrices that avoids this combinatorial constraint entirely. This is achieved by a novel characterization of acyclicity that is not only smooth but also exact. The resulting nonconvex, constrained program involves smooth functions whose gradients are easy to compute and only involve elementary matrix operations. By using existing black-box optimization routines, our method uses global search to find an optimal DAG and can be implemented in about 50 lines of Python and outperforms existing methods without imposing any structural constraints.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for causal inference in the observational social sciences. It focuses on DAGs’ main uses, discusses central principles, and gives applied examples. DAGs are visual representations of qualitative causal assumptions: They encode researchers’ beliefs about how the world works. Straightforward rules map these causal assumptions onto the associations and independencies in observable data. The two primary uses of DAGs are (1) determining the identiﬁability of causal effects from observed data and (2) deriving the testable implications of a causal model. Concepts covered in this chapter include identiﬁcation, d-separation, confounding, endogenous selection, and overcontrol. Illustrative applications then demonstrate that conditioning on variables at any stage in a causal process can induce as well as remove bias, that confounding is a fundamentally causal rather than an associational concept, that conventional approaches to causal mediation analysis are often biased, and that causal inference in social networks inherently faces endogenous selection bias. The chapter discusses several graphical criteria for the identiﬁcation of causal effects of single, time-point treatments (including the famous backdoor criterion), as well identiﬁcation criteria for multiple, time-varying treatments.},

then ruled out as violating plausible constraints on compatibility, different specifications

following results: nothing can be called a negation properly if it does not satisfy
(Minimal) Contraposition and Double Negation Introduction; the pair consisting
of two split or Galois negations encodes a distinction without a difference; some
paraconsistent negations also fail to count as real negations, but others may; intuitionistic
negation qualifies as real negation, and classical Boolean negation does as
well, to the extent that constructivist and paraconsistent doubts on it do not turn
on the basic concept of compatibility but rather on the interpretation of worlds.},

We compare with other translations of abstract argumentation networks into logic, such as classical predicate logic or modal logics, or logic programming, and we also compare with Abstract Dialectical Frameworks.},

  abstract = {Theoretical models of artiﬁcial general intelligence, such as AIXI [3], typically consider an intelligent agent to have unlimited computational resources, allowing it to keep a perfect memory of its entire interaction history with its environment. In the real world, an agent’s memory is part of the environment, which means that the latter can modify the former. This paper develops a theoretical framework for examining the implications of such real-world memory on universal intelligent agents. Within this framework we are able to show, for example, that in certain environments optimality can be achieved only with truly stochastic behaviors, and that guarantees about the trustworthiness of memories are diﬃcult to obtain even with inﬁnite computational power. To describe the probability of an agent’s memory state, we propose an adaptation of the universal prior for the passive and the active case.},

  abstract = {A key challenge in complex visuomotor control is learning abstract representations that are effective for specifying goals, planning, and generalization. To this end, we introduce universal planning networks (UPN). UPNs embed differentiable planning within a goal-directed policy. This planning computation unrolls a forward model in a latent space and infers an optimal action plan through gradient descent trajectory optimization. The plan-by-gradient-descent process and its underlying representations are learned end-to-end to directly optimize a supervised imitation learning objective. We find that the representations learned are not only effective for goal-directed visual imitation via gradient-based trajectory optimization, but can also provide a metric for specifying goals using images. The learned representations can be leveraged to specify distance-based rewards to reach new target states for model-free reinforcement learning, resulting in substantially more effective learning when solving new tasks described via image-based goals. We were able to achieve successful transfer of visuomotor planning strategies across robots with significantly different morphologies and actuation capabilities.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing concern in computer vision devices invading the privacy of their users by recording unwanted videos. On one hand, we want the camera systems/robots to recognize important events and assist human daily life by understanding its videos, but on the other hand we also want to ensure that they do not intrude people's privacy. In this paper, we propose a new principled approach for learning a video face anonymizer. We use an adversarial training setting in which two competing systems fight: (1) a video anonymizer that modifies the original video to remove privacy-sensitive information (i.e., human face) while still trying to maximize spatial action detection performance, and (2) a discriminator that tries to extract privacy-sensitive information from such anonymized videos. The end result is a video anonymizer that performs a pixel-level modification to anonymize each person's face, with minimal effect on action detection performance. We experimentally confirm the benefit of our approach compared to conventional hand-crafted video/face anonymization methods including masking, blurring, and noise adding.

We propose a conjecture, that this property is conditioned by a topological property of the processes which implement this reflexivity. These processes may be symbolic, or non symbolic e.g. connexionnist. An architecture which implements reflexivity may be based on the interaction of one or several modules of deep learning, which may be specialized or not, and interconnected in a relevant way. A necessary condition of reflexivity is the existence of recurrence in its processes, we will examine in which cases this condition may be sufficient. We will then examine how this topology and this property make possible the expression of a second property, the deliberation. In a final paragraph, we propose an evaluation of intelligent systems, based on the fulfillment of all or some of these properties.},

  abstract = {The richness of natural images makes the quest for optimal representations in image processing and computer vision challenging. The latter observation has not prevented the design of image representations, which trade off between efficiency and complexity, while achieving accurate rendering of smooth regions as well as reproducing faithful contours and textures. The most recent ones, proposed in the past decade, share an hybrid heritage highlighting the multiscale and oriented nature of edges and patterns in images. This paper presents a panorama of the aforementioned literature on decompositions in multiscale, multi-orientation bases or dictionaries. They typically exhibit redundancy to improve sparsity in the transformed domain and sometimes its invariance with respect to simple geometric deformations (translation, rotation). Oriented multiscale dictionaries extend traditional wavelet processing and may offer rotation invariance. Highly redundant dictionaries require specific algorithms to simplify the search for an efficient (sparse) representation. We also discuss the extension of multiscale geometric decompositions to non-Euclidean domains such as the sphere or arbitrary meshed surfaces. The etymology of panorama suggests an overview, based on a choice of partially overlapping "pictures". We hope that this paper will contribute to the appreciation and apprehension of a stream of current research directions in image understanding.},

  abstract = {Infants are experts at playing, with an amazing ability to generate novel structured behaviors in unstructured environments that lack clear extrinsic reward signals. We seek to mathematically formalize these abilities using a neural network that implements curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation. Using a simple but ecologically naturalistic simulated environment in which an agent can move and interact with objects it sees, we propose a "world-model" network that learns to predict the dynamic consequences of the agent's actions. Simultaneously, we train a separate explicit "self-model" that allows the agent to track the error map of its own world-model, and then uses the self-model to adversarially challenge the developing world-model. We demonstrate that this policy causes the agent to explore novel and informative interactions with its environment, leading to the generation of a spectrum of complex behaviors, including ego-motion prediction, object attention, and object gathering. Moreover, the world-model that the agent learns supports improved performance on object dynamics prediction, detection, localization and recognition tasks. Taken together, our results are initial steps toward creating flexible autonomous agents that self-supervise in complex novel physical environments.},

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised algorithm to address the problem of localizing the sound source in visual scenes. A two-stream network structure which handles each modality, with attention mechanism is developed for sound source localization. Moreover, although our network is formulated within the unsupervised learning framework, it can be extended to a unified architecture with a simple modification for the supervised and semi-supervised learning settings as well. Meanwhile, a new sound source dataset is developed for performance evaluation. Our empirical evaluation shows that the unsupervised method eventually go through false conclusion in some cases. We show that even with a few supervision, false conclusion is able to be corrected and the source of sound in a visual scene can be localized effectively.},

  abstract = {Theory of mind (ToM; Premack \& Woodruff, 1978) broadly refers to humans' ability to represent the mental states of others, including their desires, beliefs, and intentions. We propose to train a machine to build such models too. We design a Theory of Mind neural network -- a ToMnet -- which uses meta-learning to build models of the agents it encounters, from observations of their behaviour alone. Through this process, it acquires a strong prior model for agents' behaviour, as well as the ability to bootstrap to richer predictions about agents' characteristics and mental states using only a small number of behavioural observations. We apply the ToMnet to agents behaving in simple gridworld environments, showing that it learns to model random, algorithmic, and deep reinforcement learning agents from varied populations, and that it passes classic ToM tasks such as the "Sally-Anne" test (Wimmer \& Perner, 1983; Baron-Cohen et al., 1985) of recognising that others can hold false beliefs about the world. We argue that this system -- which autonomously learns how to model other agents in its world -- is an important step forward for developing multi-agent AI systems, for building intermediating technology for machine-human interaction, and for advancing the progress on interpretable AI.},

This feature distinguishes the PT from the popular Dirichlet process (DP) model which assigns probability 1 to the set of discrete distributions. However, the PT is not nearly as widely used as the DP prior. Probably the main reason is an awkward dependence of posterior inference on the choice of the partitioning subsets in the definition of the PT. We propose a generalization of the PT prior that mitigates this undesirable dependence on the partition structure, by allowing the branching probabilities to be dependent within the same level. The proposed new process is not a PT anymore. However, it is still a tail-free process and many of the prior properties remain the same as those for the PT.},

  abstract = {The majority of online content is written in languages other than English, and is most commonly encoded in UTF-8, the world's dominant Unicode character encoding. Traditional compression algorithms typically operate on individual bytes. While this approach works well for the single-byte ASCII encoding, it works poorly for UTF-8, where characters often span multiple bytes. Previous research has focused on developing Unicode compressors from scratch, which often failed to outperform established algorithms such as bzip2. We develop a technique to modify byte-based compressors to operate directly on Unicode characters, and implement variants of LZW and PPM that apply this technique. We find that our method substantially improves compression effectiveness on a UTF-8 corpus, with our PPM variant outperforming the state-of-the-art PPMII compressor. On ASCII and binary files, our variants perform similarly to the original unmodified compressors.},

  abstract = {For effective searching of appropriate information, it is necessary to well organize data to access and store in database. So, we adopt a case structure as a formalized data form. Web resources are transformed into cases which help information processing and accessing. In addition, we define common-context which are shared concepts by comparatives and propose a common-context-based conceptual similarity through arc compression on ontology. Arc-based conceptual distance between comparative nodes is calculated under consideration of common-context. One of comparatives comes from the user requirements and another from indexes of a case. The distance is contingent upon consideration of common-context. The 'Node Compression (NC)' and 'Arc Compression (AC)' are proposed to support the dynamicity of similarity. NC is conducted between adjacent common-context nodes and leads calculation of conceptual distance between comparatives. AC is processed between non-adjacent common-context nodes. The conceptual arc compression is conducted by Weighted Partial Ontology (WPO) based on weights of arcs under consideration of common-context. The proposed NC and AC support to return conceptual distance between comparatives because it increases the concept-based reliability of search result. To verify the effectiveness, the proposed conceptual similarity is compared with that of edge-counting similarity method. We show that the proposed conceptual similarity calculation leads a higher similarity value for conceptually close classes compared with other methods.},

The existing mapping method and mapping system perform well when dealing with the mapping between a lightweight small ontology. However, when comes to the large-scale ontology, it is full of challenges to the methods and systems。To this end, this paper proposes a method of ontology compression based on conceptual cluster to compress. Firstly, it calculates the semantic similarity and semantic correlation of ontology concepts with the DICE coefficient method and the information entropy technology to get semantic relation. Secondly according to the semantic relations, it carries on the conceptual cluster in the concept space so that the concept of semantic relations closely together in groups. The concept of cluster in space is reduced, and the "noise concept" which is independent of the mapping is removed, and the purpose of the large-scale ontology compression is realized. Experimental results show that the method is so effective that it can compress the volume of large-scale ontology in the mapping problems.},

Several recent papers extend the baseline to depend on both the state and action and suggest that this significantly reduces variance and improves sample efficiency without introducing bias into the gradient estimates. To better understand this development, we decompose the variance of the policy gradient estimator and numerically show that learned state-action-dependent baselines do not in fact reduce variance over a state-dependent baseline in commonly tested benchmark domains. We confirm this unexpected result by reviewing the open-source code accompanying these prior papers, and show that subtle implementation decisions cause deviations from the methods presented in the papers and explain the source of the previously observed empirical gains. Furthermore, the variance decomposition highlights areas for improvement, which we demonstrate by illustrating a simple change to the typical value function parameterization that can significantly improve performance.},

  abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},

Our principal contribution is to show that fortifying these hidden states improves the robustness of deep networks and our experiments (i) demonstrate improved robustness to standard adversarial attacks in both black-box and white-box threat models; (ii) suggest that our improvements are not primarily due to the gradient masking problem and (iii) show the advantage of doing this fortification in the hidden layers instead of the input space.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of generating interpretable and verifiable policies through reinforcement learning. Unlike the popular Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) paradigm, in which the policy is represented by a neural network, the aim in Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning is to find a policy that can be represented in a high-level programming language. Such programmatic policies have the benefits of being more easily interpreted than neural networks, and being amenable to verification by symbolic methods. We propose a new method, called Neurally Directed Program Search (NDPS), for solving the challenging nonsmooth optimization problem of finding a programmatic policy with maxima reward. NDPS works by first learning a neural policy network using DRL, and then performing a local search over programmatic policies that seeks to minimize a distance from this neural "oracle". We evaluate NDPS on the task of learning to drive a simulated car in the TORCS car-racing environment. We demonstrate that NDPS is able to discover human-readable policies that pass some significant performance bars. We also find that a well-designed policy language can serve as a regularizer, and result in the discovery of policies that lead to smoother trajectories and are more easily transferred to environments not encountered during training.},

  title = {Model-Code Separation Architectures for Compression Based on Message-Passing},
  url = {http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/97802},
  abstract = {Data is compressible by presuming a priori knowledge known as a data model, and applying an appropriate encoding to produce a shorter description. The two aspects of compression data modeling and coding - however are not always conceived as distinct, nor implemented as such in compression systems, leading to difficulties of an architectural nature. For example, how would one make improvements upon a data model whose specific form has been standardized into the encoding and decoding processes? How would one design coding for new types of data such as in biology and finance, without creating a new system in each case? How would one compress data that has been encrypted when the conventional encoder requires data-in-the-clear to extract redundancy? And how would mobile acquisition devices obtain good compression with lightweight encoders? These and many other challenges can be tackled by an alternative compression architecture. This work contributes a complete "model-code separation" system architecture for compression, based on a core set of iterative message-passing algorithms over graphical models representing the modeling and coding aspects of compression. Systems following this architecture resolve the challenges posed by current systems, and stand to benefit further from future advances in the understanding of data and the algorithms that process them. In the main portion of this thesis, the lossless compression of binary sources is examined. Examples are compressed under the proposed architecture and compared against some of the best systems today and to theoretical limits. They show that the flexibility of model-code separation does not incur a performance penalty. Indeed, the compression performance of such systems is competitive with and sometimes superior to existing solutions. The architecture is further extended to diverse situations of practical interest, such as mismatched and partially known models, different data and code alphabets, and lossy compression. In the process, insights into model uncertainty and universality, data representation and alphabet translation, and model-quantizer separation and low-complexity quantizer design are revealed. In many ways, the proposed architecture is uniquely suitable for understanding and tackling these problems. Throughout, a discourse is maintained over architectural and complexity issues, with a view toward practical implementability. Of interest to system designers, issues such as rate selection, doping, and code selection are addressed, and a method similar to EXIT-chart analysis is developed for evaluating when compression is possible. Suggestions for system interfaces and algorithmic factorization are distilled, and examples showing compression with realistic data and tasks are given to complete the description of a system architecture accessible to broader adoption. Ultimately, this work develops one architecturally principled approach toward flexible, modular, and extensible compression system design, with practical benefits. More broadly, it represents the beginning of many directions for promising research at the intersection of data compression, information theory, machine learning, coding, and random algorithms.},

  abstract = {Predictive models deployed in the real world may assign incorrect labels to instances with high confidence. Such errors or unknown unknowns are rooted in model incompleteness, and typically arise because of the mismatch between training data and the cases encountered at test time. As the models are blind to such errors, input from an oracle is needed to identify these failures. In this paper, we formulate and address the problem of informed discovery of unknown unknowns of any given predictive model where unknown unknowns occur due to systematic biases in the training data. We propose a model-agnostic methodology which uses feedback from an oracle to both identify unknown unknowns and to intelligently guide the discovery. We employ a two-phase approach which first organizes the data into multiple partitions based on the feature similarity of instances and the confidence scores assigned by the predictive model, and then utilizes an explore-exploit strategy for discovering unknown unknowns across these partitions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by varying the underlying causes of unknown unknowns across various applications. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first algorithmic approach to the problem of discovering unknown unknowns of predictive models.},

  title = {Automated {{Synthesis}} of {{Body Schema}} Using {{Multiple Sensor Modalities}}},
  abstract = {The way in which organisms create body schema, based on their interactions with the real world, is an unsolved problem in neuroscience. Similarly, in evolutionary robotics, a robot learns to behave in the real world either without recourse to an internal model (requiring at least hundreds of interactions), or a model is hand designed by the experimenter (requiring much prior knowledge about the robot and its environment). In this paper we present a method that allows a physical robot to automatically synthesize a body schema, using multimodal sensor data that it obtains through interaction with the real world. Furthermore, this synthesis can be either parametric (the experimenter provides an approximate model and the robot then reﬁnes the model) or topological: the robot synthesizes a predictive model of its own body plan using little prior knowledge. We show that this latter type of synthesis can occur when a physical quadrupedal robot performs only nine, 5-second interactions with its environment.},

  title = {Automatic {{Synthesis}} of {{Multiple Internal Models Through Active Exploration}}},
  abstract = {An important question in cognitive science is whether in-ternal models are encoded in the brain of higher animals at birth, and are only subsequently refined through experi-ence, or whether models are synthesized over the lifetime of an animal-and if so, how are they formed. A further question is whether animals maintain a single model of a particular body part or tool, or whether multiple competing models are maintained simultaneously. In this paper we de-scribe a co-evolutionary algorithm that automatically synthe-sizes and maintains multiple candidate models of a behav-ing robot. These predictive models can then be used to gen-erate new controllers to either elicit some desired behavior under uncertainty (where competing models agree on the re-sulting behavior); or determine actions that uncover hidden components of the target robot (where models disagree, indi-cating further model synthesis is required). We demonstrate automated model synthesis from sensor data; model synthesis'from scratch'(little initial knowledge about the robot's mor-phology is assumed); and integrated, continued model syn-thesis and controller design. This new modeling methodol-ogy may shed light on how models are acquired and main-tained in higher organisms for the purpose of prediction and anticipation.},

Although such robustness would be desirable in engineered systems, most machines fail in the face of unexpected damage. We describe a robot that can recover from such change autonomously, through continuous self-modeling. A four-legged machine uses actuation-sensation relationships to indirectly infer its own structure, and it then uses this self-model to generate forward locomotion. When a leg part is removed, it adapts the self-models, leading to the generation of alternative gaits. This concept may help develop more robust machines and shed light on self-modeling in animals.
When it receives appropriate sensory information, a mobile robot can compensate for damage to one of its four legs by updating an internal model of itself.

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the “alphabet” used to describe those systems.
An algorithm has been developed to search for natural laws of physics in large data sets.

This report proposes several efficient ways to set the hyper-parameters that significantly reduce training time and improves performance. Specifically, this report shows how to examine the training validation/test loss function for subtle clues of underfitting and overfitting and suggests guidelines for moving toward the optimal balance point. Then it discusses how to increase/decrease the learning rate/momentum to speed up training. Our experiments show that it is crucial to balance every manner of regularization for each dataset and architecture. Weight decay is used as a sample regularizer to show how its optimal value is tightly coupled with the learning rates and momentums.},

Examples of such data sources are social networks, biological data, web graphs, etc. Our goal is to design schemes that can efficiently compress and store such data. We aim for universal compression, i.e. without making assumptions about the stochastic properties of the data. To make sense of this, we employ the framework of local weak convergence, also called the objective method, which formalizes the notion of stationary stochastic processes indexed by graphs. We generalize a recently developed notion of entropy for such processes, due to Bordenave and Caputo, to the case of marked graphs, and argue that it is an appropriate way to evaluate the efficiency of a compression scheme. The lossless compression scheme we propose in this paper is then proved to be universally optimal. It is also capable of performing local data queries in the compressed form.},

This problem is relevant to a wide range of fields and is integral to the philosophy of science. It has been tackled by many great minds ranging from philosophers to scientists to mathematicians, and more recently computer scientists. In this article we argue the case for Solomonoff Induction, a formal inductive framework which combines algorithmic information theory with the Bayesian framework. Although it achieves excellent theoretical results and is based on solid philosophical foundations, the requisite technical knowledge necessary for understanding this framework has caused it to remain largely unknown and unappreciated in the wider scientific community. The main contribution of this article is to convey Solomonoff induction and its related concepts in a generally accessible form with the aim of bridging this current technical gap. In the process we examine the major historical contributions that have led to the formulation of Solomonoff Induction as well as criticisms of Solomonoff and induction in general. In particular we examine how Solomonoff induction addresses many issues that have plagued other inductive systems, such as the black ravens paradox and the confirmation problem, and compare this approach with other recent approaches.},

It is, for example, becoming increasingly important for satisfying the requirements of fitting a large database onto a single CD-ROM. Many of the compression techniques discussed in the literature are model based. We here propose the notion of a formal grammar as a flexible model of text generation that encompasses most of the models offered before as well as, in principle, extending the possibility of compression to a much more general class of languages. Assuming a general model of text generation, a derivation is given of the well known Shannon entropy formula, making possible a theory of information based upon text representation rather than on communication. The ideas are shown to apply to a number of commonly used text models. Finally, we focus on a Markov model of text generation, suggest an information theoretic measure of similarity between two probability distributions, and develop a clustering algorithm based on this measure. This algorithm allows us to cluster Markov states, and thereby base our compression algorithm on a smaller number of probability distributions than would otherwise have been required. A number of theoretical consequences of this approach to compression are explored, and a detailed example is given.},

  abstract = {This thesis develops a method for automatically constructing, visualizing and describing 
a large class of models, useful for forecasting and finding structure in domains such 
as time series, geological formations, and physical dynamics. These models, based on 
Gaussian processes, can capture many types of statistical structure, such as periodicity, 
changepoints, additivity, and symmetries. Such structure can be encoded through kernels, 
which have historically been hand-chosen by experts. We show how to automate 
this task, creating a system that explores an open-ended space of models and reports 
the structures discovered. 
 
To automatically construct Gaussian process models, we search over sums and products 
of kernels, maximizing the approximate marginal likelihood. We show how any 
model in this class can be automatically decomposed into qualitatively different parts, 
and how each component can be visualized and described through text. We combine 
these results into a procedure that, given a dataset, automatically constructs a model 
along with a detailed report containing plots and generated text that illustrate the 
structure discovered in the data. 
 
The introductory chapters contain a tutorial showing how to express many types of 
structure through kernels, and how adding and multiplying different kernels combines 
their properties. Examples also show how symmetric kernels can produce priors over 
topological manifolds such as cylinders, toruses, and Möbius strips, as well as their 
higher-dimensional generalizations. 
 
This thesis also explores several extensions to Gaussian process models. First, building 
on existing work that relates Gaussian processes and neural nets, we analyze natural 
extensions of these models to deep kernels and deep Gaussian processes. Second, we examine 
additive Gaussian processes, showing their relation to the regularization method 
of dropout. Third, we combine Gaussian processes with the Dirichlet process to produce 
the warped mixture model: a Bayesian clustering model having nonparametric cluster 
shapes, and a corresponding latent space in which each cluster has an interpretable 
parametric form.},

Compression algorithms are derived for a variety of applications, employing probabilistic modelling, Bayesian inference, and arithmetic coding; and making the underlying probability distributions explicit throughout. A general compression toolbox is described, consisting of practical algorithms for compressing data distributed by various fundamental probability distributions, and mechanisms for combining these algorithms in a principled way. New mathematical theory is introduced for compressing objects with an underlying combinatorial structure, such as permutations, combinations, and multisets. For text compression, a novel unifying construction is developed for a family of context-sensitive compression algorithms, special cases of which include the PPM algorithm and the Sequence Memoizer. The work concludes with experimental results, example applications, and a brief discussion on cost-sensitive compression and adversarial sequences.},

For example, Goldbach’s conjecture (that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes) is understood as an infinite conjunction ‘4 is the sum of two primes and 6 is the sum of two primes and 8 is the sum of two primes and…’. Wright (1980, I, §7) quotes this example and asks, since we understand the decidable predicate ‘is the sum of two primes’, the binary operation ‘and’, and the sequence of even numbers (which we can effectively enumerate), how can we possibly doubt that Goldbach’s conjecture is a meaningful proposition? The answer is obvious: the dubious part is the three dots ‘…’. I shall spend this chapter examining these strange punctuation marks. They can be understood in two ways, traditionally called ‘potential infinity’ and ‘actual infinity’. ‘Actual infinity’ means viewing the quantifiers as infinitary analogues of conjunction and disjunction: I shall argue that this is meaningless. ‘Potential infinity’ means viewing the quantifiers, and all other apparent references to infinities, in terms of the counting algorithm and other computational procedures: I shall defend this basic notion of computation against Wittgenstein.},

  abstract = {Geology is the study of rocks; astronomy is the study of stars; what is mathematics the study of? Mathematics has been variously construed as the science of numbers or abstract structures, as deductive reasoning in general, as a game with symbols, as a process of free mental ‘construction’, and as a very abstract branch of theoretical physics. Since we cannot agree on its subject matter it is not surprising that we differ on what philosophical questions to ask about it, what is required to justify it, or indeed whether it needs any sort of extra-mathematical foundation. In this chapter I shall try to formulate the correct question and to distinguish it from irrelevancies.},

In this chapter I shall argue that ‘set-theoretic intuition’, as formalised in the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms with the axiom of choice (ZFC), is conceptually incoherent.

Open-endedness (also called essential incompleteness and incompletability) implies that a foundation for mathematics can never be entirely formal.

This means that the usual depth first search strategy for backwards construction of deductions of given sequents may give rise to infinite search paths and is not guaranteed to terminate. Thus using such a search strategy prevents us not only from obtaining a decision procedure for the logic in question, but even from arriving at a complete proof procedure. There are two well known approaches for overcoming this problem: both approaches rely on the fact that all formulas which occur in a deduction are subformulas of the end-sequent and that out of these formulas one may only form finitely many “essentially different” sequents. Thus although there is no bound on the length of all deductions of a given sequent, we know that for any given sequent there is a number such that if the sequent is deducible at all, then it has a deduction of length smaller than this number. Hence by only considering deductions of appropriately bounded length one may obtain a decision procedure. But due to the fact that using such a procedure one is forced to construct many redundant inferences—one will, for instance, have to consecutively apply the same inference many times—this approach is considered rather inefficient.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to give a survey of the relational formalization of modal logics. The paradigm ‘formulas are relations’ leads to the development of a relational logic based on algebras of relations. The logic can be viewed as a generic logic for the representation of nonclassical logics; in particular a broad class of multimodal logics can be specified within its framework. As a consequence, proof systems for the relational logic become a convenient tool for the development of a proof theory for nonclassical logics. The relational logic enables us to represent within a uniform formalism the three basic components of any propositional logical system: syntax, semantics and deduction apparatus. The essential observation, leading to a relational formalization of logical systems, is that a standard relational structure (a Boolean algebra with a monoid) constitutes a common core of a great variety of nonclassical logics. Exhibiting this common core on all the three levels of syntax, semantics and deduction, enables us to create a general framework for representation, investigation and implementation of nonclassical logics.},

  abstract = {The present paper explores applications of Display Logic as defined in [1] to modal logic. Acquaintance with that paper is presupposed, although we will give all necessary definitions. Display Logic is a rather elegant proof-theoretic system that was developed to explore in depth the possibility of total Gentzenization of various propositional logics. By Gentzenization I understand the strategy to replace connectives by structures. Gentzenization is something of an ingenious optical trick because it uses a single symbol to mean different things depending on the place it occupies in the sequent. In the original Gentzen system it was the comma that had to be interpreted as and when to the left of the turnstile and as or when to the right. The interpretation of the structures oscillates between two logical symbols depending on whether it is in the antecedent or in the consequent. This is why we call symbols like comma Gentzen toggles. These two symbols between which this toggle switches are the Gentzen duals of each other. So, and and or are Gentzen duals. The strength of Display logic lies in a rather general cut-elimination theorem. In [10] and [9], Heinrich Wansing has refined these methods for modal logics; he showed that contrary to Belnap’s own Gentzenization of modal operators as binary structure operators, a unary one is more appropriate (not only from an esthetical point of view) and makes perfect sense semantically as well. The Gentzen dual of the modal operator □ is actually not — as one might expect — the. possibility operator ◇, but the backward looking possibility operator, denoted here by ◇. (To be consistent with that we write □ instead of □ and ◇ instead of ◇.) The corresponding toggle is denoted by •. The reason why this is so natural lies in the fact that it is the exact Display or Gentzen dual, for we have that the sequent •B ⊢ A and the sequent B ⊢ • A are equivalent if • is read as if in the antecedent and if it is read as 0 if in the consequent. Wansing uses this fact to display various modal and tense logics à la Belnap by providing some formula introduction rules and basic structural rules for K and Kt and then Gentzenizing the additional axioms. The benefit lies not only in the homogeneity with which all these systems are now handled and the rather clear intuitive background. The benefit lies in the possibility to use the general cut-elimination theorem of [1].},

This modal functional completeness is related to the modal version of the deduction theorem of [3] as functional completeness for bicartesian closed categories is related to the deduction theorem for intuitionistic propositional logic. Roughly speaking, the deduction theorem says that the system is strong enough to express its own deductive metatheory. Functional completeness says that the deductive metatheory can be embedded in the system.},

Of course, these constraints must leave the connectives in Σ explicitly definable from finite combinations of connectives in Ω. The problem of functional completeness for ℒ consists in finding a proper subclass Γ of Ω such that every connective in Ω is explicitly definable by a finite number of compositions from the elements of Γ. In a proof-theoretic semantics for ℒ, the class Ω of permissible connectives is given by general schemata for introducing finitary operations into premises and conclusions; see, for instance, [6], [7], [9], [10], [11] for proof-theoretic proofs of functional completeness for minimal propositional logic, intuitionistic propositional logic, Nelson’s constructive propositional logics and various substructural subsystems of these logics.},

One of most debatedtopics in belief revision theory is the recovery postulate, accordingto which all the original beliefs are regained if one of them is firstremoved and then reinserted. The recovery postulate holds in the AGMmodel but not in closely related models employing belief bases.Another much discussed topic is how repeated changes can be adequatelyrepresented. Several alternative models have been proposed that areintended to provide a more realistic account of belief change thanthat offered by the AGM model.},

Called‘relevant logics’ in Britain and Australasia, thesesystems developed as attempts to avoid the paradoxes of material andstrict implication.  Among the paradoxes of material implicationare, Among the paradoxes of strict implication are the following:, Many philosophers, beginning with Hugh MacColl (1908), have claimedthat these theses are counterintuitive. They claim that these formulaefail to be valid if we interpret → as representing the concept ofimplication that we have before we learn classical logic. Relevancelogicians claim that what is unsettling about these so-calledparadoxes is that in each of them the antecedent seems irrelevant tothe consequent., In addition, relevance logicians have had qualms about certaininferences that classical logic makes valid. For example, consider theclassically valid inference, Again here there seems to be a failure of relevance. The conclusionseems to have nothing to do with the premise. Relevance logicians haveattempted to construct logics that reject theses and arguments thatcommit “fallacies of relevance”., Relevant logicians point out that what is wrong with some of theparadoxes (and fallacies) is that is that the antecedents andconsequents (or premises and conclusions) are on completely differenttopics. The notion of a topic, however, would seem not to be somethingthat a logician should be interested in — it has to do with thecontent, not the form, of a sentence or inference. But there is aformal principle that relevant logicians apply to force theorems andinferences to “stay on topic”. This is the variablesharing principle. The variable sharing principle says that noformula of the form A → B can be proven in a relevance logic if Aand B do not have at least one propositional variable (sometimescalled a proposition letter) in common and that no inference can beshown valid if the premises and conclusion do not share at least onepropositional variable., At this point some confusion is natural about what relevant logiciansare attempting to do. The variable sharing principle is only anecessary condition that a logic must have to count as a relevancelogic. It is not sufficient. Moreover, this principle does not give usa criterion that eliminates all of the paradoxes and fallacies. Someremain paradoxical or fallacious even though they satisfy variablesharing. As we shall see, however, relevant logic does provide us witha relevant notion of proof in terms of the real use of premises (seethe section “Proof Theory” below), but it does not byitself tell us what counts as a true (and relevant) implication. It isonly when the formal theory is put together with a philosophicalinterpretation that it can do this (see the section“Semantics for Relevant Implication” below)., In this article we will give a brief and relatively non-technicaloverview of the field of relevance logic.},

  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/logic-connexive/},
  abstract = {Connexive logic is a comparatively little-known and to some extentneglected branch of non-classical logic. Systems of connexive logic areneither subsystems nor extensions of classical logic. Connexive logicshave a standard logical vocabulary and comprise certain non-theoremsof classical logic as theses. Since classical propositional logic isPost-complete, any additional axiom in its language gives rise to thetrivial system, so that any non-trivial system of connexive logic willhave to leave out some theorems of classical logic. The name‘connexive logic’ suggests that systems of connexive logic are motivated by some ideas about coherence or connection between premises and conclusions of valid inferences or between formulas of a certain shape. The kind of coherence in question concerns the meaning of implication and negation (see the entries on  conditionals and negation)., One basic idea is that no formula provably implies or is implied byits own negation. This conception may be expressed by requiring thatfor every formula A,,  but usually the underlying intuitions are expressed by requiring thatcertain schematic formulas are theorems:, The first formula is often called Aristotle's Thesis. If thisnon-theorem of classical logic is found plausible, then the secondprinciple, AT′, would seem to enjoy the same degree ofplausibility. Indeed, also AT′ is sometimes referred to asAristotle's Thesis. As McCall (1975, 435) explains, , Using intuitionistically acceptable means only, the pair of theses ATand AT′ is equivalent in deductive power with another pair ofschemata, which in established terminology are called (Strong)Boethius' Theses and which may be viewed (in addition withtheir converses) as capturing Chrysippus' idea: , The names ‘Aristotle's Theses’ and ‘Boethius'Theses’ are, of course, not arbitrarily chosen. AT, for example,is assumed at Aristotle's Prior Analytics 57b14,where it is explained that:, Moreover, Boethius, for instance, holds that ‘if A then\textasciitilde{}B’ is the negation of ‘if A, thenB’ (Kneale and Kneale 1962, p. 191).

Aristotle's Second Thesis andAbelard's First Principle are interderivable with BT and withBT′ using intuitionistic principles only., Let L be a language containing a unary connective \textasciitilde(negation) and a binary connective → (implication). A logicalsystem in a language extending L is called a connexivelogic if AT, AT′, BT, and BT′ are theorems and,moreover, (A→B) →(B→A) fails to be a theorem (so that → canhardly be understood as a bi-conditional). The connective → in asystem of connexive logic is said to be a connexiveimplication.  Kapsner (2012) refers to a logic that satisfies AT,AT′, BT, and BT′ and, moreover, satisfies the requirementthat (a) in no model A→\textasciitilde{}A is satisfiable (forany A) and (b) in no model A→B andA→\textasciitilde{}B are simultaneoulsy satisfiable (for anyA and B), as strongly connexive, whereas ifthe conditions (a) and (b) are not both satisfied, the system is onlycalled weakly connexive.},

Paraconsistent, inconsistency-tolerant logics have been studied to cope with such inconsistencies. In this paper, proof systems for Nelson’s paraconsistent logic N4 are comprehensively studied. The logic N4 is a fundamental system and known to be a common basis for various extended and useful paraconsistent logics.

  abstract = {We introduce KBE, a modal epistemic logic for reasoning about Knowledge, Belief and Estimation, three attitudes involved in an agent’s decision-making process. In our logic, Knowledge and Belief are captured by S4.2, a modal logic holding a distinguished position among the epistemic logics investigated in AI and Philosophy. The Estimation operator of KBE is a kind of generalized ‘many’ or ‘most’ quantifier, whose origins go back to the work of J. Burgess and A. Herzig, but its model-theoretic incarnation (‘weak filters’) has been introduced by K. Schlechta and V. Jauregui. We work with complete weak filters (‘weak ultrafilters’) as we are interested in situations where an estimation can be always reached. The axiomatization of KBE comprises ‘bridge’ axioms which reflect the intuitive relationship of ‘estimation’ to ‘knowledge’ and ‘belief’, several introspective properties are shown to hold and it comes out that believing ϕ can be equivalently defined in KBE as ‘estimating that ϕ is known’, an interesting fact and an indication of the intuitive correctness of the introduced estimation operator. The model theory of KBE comprises a class of frames combining relational Kripke frames with Scott-Montague semantics, in which neighborhoods are collections of ‘large’ sets of possible worlds. Soundness and completeness is mentioned and a tableaux proof procedure is sketched.},

  edition = {Winter 2016},
  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/dynamic-semantics/},
  abstract = {Dynamic semantics is a perspective on natural language semantics thatemphasizes the growth of information in time. It is an approach tomeaning representation where pieces of text or discourse are viewed asinstructions to update an existing context with new information, theresult of which is an updated context. In a slogan: meaning is contextchange potential. , It is important to be aware of the abstractness of this perspective soas to guard against various non sequiturs. For one thing, one couldeasily think that dynamic semantics or update semantics is committedat least in part to an internalist idea of semantics since theinformation states are “internal”—in the sense thatthey are wholly contained in the individual mind/brain. In otherwords, one might think that the information states of dynamicsemantics are what Putnam (1975) calls “states in the sense ofmethodological solipsism”. See the entries on scientific realism, computational theory of mind, externalism about mental content, and narrow mental content. However, the general framework says nothing about what the statesare. The state could very well include the environment in which theinterpreter is embedded and thus contain an “external”component., A second possible misunderstanding is that dynamic semantics or updatesemantics is in complete opposition to classical truth conditionalsemantics (compare the entries on classical logic and first-order model theory). In fact, as this entry will soon make clear, what dynamic semanticsprovides is a generalization of truth conditional semantics ratherthan a radically different alternative. The classical meanings becomethe preconditions for success of the discourse actions.Dynamic semanticists claim that compositional meanings havethe nature of functions or relations and the classical meanings arerecoverable from the relational dynamic meanings asprojections onto their “input” coordinate., The point of the use of an abstract framework is not to give empiricalpredictions. This is the task of specific realizations inside theframework. The framework of dynamic semantics (i) provides a directionof thinking and (ii) allows us to import methods from the mathematicalstudy of the framework. It follows that the question whether naturallanguage meaning is intrinsically dynamic does not have an empiricalanswer. Still, what can be said is that the study of interpretation asa linearly-ordered process has proven quite fruitful andrewarding., Since dynamic semantics focuses on the discourse actions of sender andreceiver, it is in a sense close to use-oriented approaches to meaningin philosophy such as the work of Wittgenstein and Dummett. However,easy identifications between dynamic semantics and these approachesare to be avoided. Dynamic semantics as an abstract framework iscompatible with many philosophical ways of viewing meaning andinterpretation. Dynamic semantics aims to model meaning andinterpretation. You can do that without answering broaderphilosophical questions such as the question of what it is that makesit possible for the subject to be related to these meanings at all.For example, in dynamic predicate logic we take the meaning ofhorse as given without making any substantial claim aboutwhat it means for a subject to have the concept of horse; wejust stipulate the subject has it. This is not to say suchquestions—which are at the center of the work of Wittgensteinand Dummett—should not ultimately be answered: it’s justthat a model can be of interest even if it does not answer them. (Notethat dynamic semantics tries to give a systematic and compositionalaccount of meaning, which makes it markedly different in spirit fromWittgenstein’s later philosophy.), One approach to dynamic semantics is discourse representation theory (DRT, Kamp 1981). (Closely related to Kamp’s approach is IreneHeim’s file change semantics (FCS, Heim 1983a) and thediscourse semantics of Seuren 1985). Meanings in DRT are so-calleddiscourse representation structures (DRSs). These structuresare a type of database that contains specific pieces of information.In and of itself a DRS is a static object, but DRT can be said to be adynamic semantic framework because it allows us to understand theprocess of composing meanings as a process of mergingdiscourse representation structures. In this way, information changebecomes an integral part of the interpretation process., Our main focus in this entry is a second approach to dynamicsemantics, although we will compare things to DRT along the way. Inthis second approach, dynamic meanings are types of actions, thingsthat are individuated by the changes they effect. This is the approachassociated with dynamic predicate logic (DPL, Groenendijk andStokhof 1991a). According to this dynamic semantic tradition, ameaning is a specification of how a receiver’s information statewould be modified. It could for instance be a function that maps anold information state to one which has been updated with theinformation that the meaning embodies. Alternatively, it could be arelation that expresses the kind of information change that themeaning brings about. (For early work in this tradition, seeGroenendijk and Stokhof 1991a,b; Muskens 1991; Dekker 1993; Vermeulen1993; van Eijck 1994; Vermeulen 1994; Krahmer 1995; van den Berg 1996;Groenendijk et al. 1996; Aloni 1997; Muskens et al. 1997).},

That is, \$\{$\backslash$sf x\}\$ can access \$\{$\backslash$sf y\}\$ if an electromagnetic or (slower than light) mechanical signal could be sent from \$\{$\backslash$sf x\}\$ to \$\{$\backslash$sf y\}\$. We use Prior's tense language of \$\{$\backslash$bf F\}\$ and \$\{$\backslash$bf P\}\$ representing causal accessibility and its converse relation. We consider two versions, one where the accessibility relation is reflexive and one where it is irreflexive. In either case it has been an open problem, for decades, whether the logic is decidable or axiomatisable. We make a small step forward by proving, for the case where the accessibility relation is irreflexive, that the set of valid formulas over two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is decidable, decidability for the reflexive case follows from this. The complexity of either problem is PSPACE-complete. A consequence is that the temporal logic of intervals with real endpoints under either the containment relation or the strict containment relation is PSPACE-complete, the same is true if the interval accessibility relation is "each endpoint is not earlier", or its irreflexive restriction. We provide a temporal formula that distinguishes between three-dimensional and two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and another temporal formula that distinguishes the two-dimensional case where the underlying field is the real numbers from the case where instead we use the rational numbers.},

  abstract = {Computational analysis of time-course data with an underlying causal structure is needed in a variety of domains, including neural spike trains, stock price movements, and gene expression levels. However, it can be challenging to determine from just the numerical time course data alone what is coordinating the visible processes, to separate the underlying prima facie causes into genuine and spurious causes and to do so with a feasible computational complexity. For this purpose, we have been developing a novel algorithm based on a framework that combines notions of causality in philosophy with algorithmic approaches built on model checking and statistical techniques for multiple hypotheses testing. The causal relationships are described in terms of temporal logic formulae, reframing the inference problem in terms of model checking. The logic used, PCTL, allows description of both the time between cause and effect and the probability of this relationship being observed. We show that equipped with these causal formulae with their associated probabilities we may compute the average impact a cause makes to its effect and then discover statistically significant causes through the concepts of multiple hypothesis testing (treating each causal relationship as a hypothesis), and false discovery control. By exploring a well-chosen family of potentially all significant hypotheses with reasonably minimal description length, it is possible to tame the algorithm's computational complexity while exploring the nearly complete search-space of all prima facie causes. We have tested these ideas in a number of domains and illustrate them here with two examples.},

The new logic extends the causal theories formalism of McCain and Turner, and provides a more adequate semantic account of it. A useful subset of the logic has a concise translation into classical propositional logic, and so can be used for automated planning and reasoning about action. A larger subset is closely related to logic programming under the answer set semantics, yielding another approach to automated reasoning. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

AI has drawn on many researchmethodologies:  the value and relative importance of logical formalismsis questioned by some leading practitioners, and has been debated inthe literature from time to time.[3] But most members of the AI communitywould agree that logic has an important role to play in at least somecentral areas of AI research, and an influential minority considerslogic to be the most important factor in enabling strategic,fundamental advances., The relations between AI and philosophical logic are part of alarger story. It is hard to find a major philosophical theme thatdoesn't become entangled with issues having to do with reasoning.Implicatures, for instance, have to correspond to inferences that canbe carried out by a rational interpreter of discourse. Whatevercausality is, causal relations should be inferrable in everyday commonsense settings. Whatever belief is, it should be possible for rationalagents to make plausible inferences about the beliefs of other agents.The goals and standing constraints that inform a rational agent'sbehavior must permit the formation of reasonable plans., In each of these cases, compatibility with an acceptable account ofthe relevant reasoning is essential for a successful philosophicaltheory. But the methods in the contemporary philosophical inventory aretoo crude to provide anything like an adequate account of reasoningthat is this complex and this entangled in broad world knowledge., Bringing an eclectic set of conceptual tools to the problem ofidealized reasoning in realistic settings, and using computers to modeland test the theories, research in AI has transformed the study ofreasoning—especially of practical, common sense reasoning. Thisprocess and its outcome is well documented in Russell \& Norvig 2010., The new insights and theories that have emerged from AI are, Ibelieve, of great potential value in informing and constraining manyareas of philosophical inquiry. The special case of philosophical logic thatforms the theme of this article may provide support for the moregeneral point. Although logic in AI grew out of philosophical logic, inits new setting it has produced new theories and ambitious programsthat would not have been possible outside of a community devoted tobuilding full-scale computational models of rational agency., I imagine that the audience for this entry will consist primarily ofphilosophers who have little or no familiarity with AI. In writing thissurvey, I have tried to concentrate on the issues that arise when logicis used in understanding problems in intelligent reasoning and guidingthe design of mechanized reasoning systems. Logic in AI is a large andrapidly growing field—I haven't tried to achieve anything likecomplete coverage. In Section 3 and Section 4 I have tried to provide an overview with some historical andtechnical details concerning nonmonotonic logic and reasoning aboutaction and change, a topic that is not only central in AI but thatshould be of considerable interest to philosophers. The remainingsections provide brief and more or less inadequate sketches ofselected topics, with references to the primary literature.,  Minker 2000b is a comprehensivecollection of survey papers and original contributions to the field oflogic-based AI, with extensive references to the literature.  Jack Minker'sintroduction, Minker 2000a, is a usefulorientation to the field. I recommend this volume asa beginning point for readers who wish to pursue this topicfurther.  Brachman\& Levesque 2004a provides an introduction to the field ofknowledge representation in textbook form.  Davis 1991a andMueller 2006a are book-length treatmentsof the challenging problem of formalizing commonsense reasoning.  Antonelli 2012a is a good entry pointfor readers interested in nonmonotonic logic, andShanahan 2009a is a useful discussion ofthe frame problem.  Wooldridge 2000a deals with logicalformalizations of rational agents., Contents of this entry:},

  abstract = {Reasoning is defeasible when the corresponding argument isrationally compelling but not deductively valid. The truth of thepremises of a good defeasible argument provide support for theconclusion, even though it is possible for the premises to be true andthe conclusion false. In other words, the relationship of supportbetween premises and conclusion is a tentative one, potentiallydefeated by additional information. Philosophers have studied thenature of defeasible reasoning since Aristotle’s analysis ofdialectical reasoning in the Topics and thePosterior Analytics, but the subject has been studied withunique intensity over the last forty years, largely due to theinterest it attracted from the artificial intelligence movement incomputer science. There have been two approaches to the study ofreasoning: treating it either as a branch of epistemology (the studyof knowledge) or as a branch of logic. In recent work, the termdefeasible reasoning has typically been limited to inferencesinvolving rough-and-ready, exception-permitting generalizations, thatis, inferring what has or will happen on the basis of whatnormally happens. This narrower sense of defeasiblereasoning, which will be the subject of this article, excludesfrom the topic the study of other forms of non-deductive reasoning,including inference to the best explanation, abduction, analogicalreasoning, and scientific induction. This exclusion is to some extentartificial, but it reflects the fact that the formal study of theseother forms of non-deductive reasoning remains quite rudimentary.},

  abstract = {Intuitionistic logic, in which the double negation law not-not-P = P fails, is dominant in categorical logic, notably in topos theory. This paper follows a different direction in which double negation does hold. The algebraic notions of effect algebra/module that emerged in theoretical physics form the cornerstone. It is shown that under mild conditions on a category, its maps of the form X -$>$ 1+1 carry such effect module structure, and can be used as predicates. Predicates are identified in many different situations, and capture for instance ordinary subsets, fuzzy predicates in a probabilistic setting, idempotents in a ring, and effects (positive elements below the unit) in a C*-algebra or Hilbert space. In quantum foundations the duality between states and effects plays an important role. It appears here in the form of an adjunction, where we use maps 1 -$>$ X as states. For such a state s and a predicate p, the validity probability s |= p is defined, as an abstract Born rule. It captures many forms of (Boolean or probabilistic) validity known from the literature. Measurement from quantum mechanics is formalised categorically in terms of `instruments', using L$\backslash$"uders rule in the quantum case. These instruments are special maps associated with predicates (more generally, with tests), which perform the act of measurement and may have a side-effect that disturbs the system under observation. This abstract description of side-effects is one of the main achievements of the current approach. It is shown that in the special case of C*-algebras, side-effect appear exclusively in the non-commutative case. Also, these instruments are used for test operators in a dynamic logic that can be used for reasoning about quantum programs/protocols. The paper describes four successive assumptions, towards a categorical axiomatisation of quantitative logic for probabilistic and quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Machine learning often needs to estimate density from a multidimensional data sample, including modelling correlations between coordinates. Additionally, we often have missing data case: that data points contain only partial information - can miss information about some of coordinates. This article adapts rapid parametric density estimation technique for this purpose: modelling density as a linear combination of orthonormal functions, for which \$L\^2\$ optimization says that (independently) estimated coefficient for a given function is just average over the sample of value of this function. Hierarchical correlation reconstruction first models probability density for each separate coordinate using all its appearances in data sample, then adds corrections from independently modelled pairwise correlations using all samples having both coordinates, and so on independently adding correlations for growing numbers of variables using decreasing evidence in our data sample. A basic application of such modelled multidimensional density can be imputation of missing coordinates: by inserting known coordinates to the density, and taking expected values for the missing coordinates, and maybe also variance to estimate their uncertainty. Biological neurons are seen as able to model and predict signals - the simplicity and flexibility of the presented approach makes it perfect for such biology-inspired artificial neuron.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment), a reinforcement learning environment based on the StarCraft II game. This domain poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more difficult class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of StarCraft II gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are unable to make significant progress. Thus, SC2LE offers a new and challenging environment for exploring deep reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures.},

Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo’s own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo’s games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100–0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.},

Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0.

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and significant improvements on ImageNet.

On the ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy. Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place.

  edition = {Winter 2017},
  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/modality-epistemology/},
  abstract = {Whereas facts about what is actual are facts about how thingsare, facts about modality (i.e., what is possible, necessary,or impossible) are facts about how things could, must, or could nothave been. For example, while there are in fact eleven players on asoccer team, there could have been thirteen, though therecouldn’t have been zero. The first of these is a fact about whatis actual; the second is a fact about what was possible, and the thirdis a fact about what is impossible. Humans are often disposed toconsider, make, and evaluate judgments about what is possible andnecessary, such as when we are motivated to make things better andimagine how things might be. We judge that things could have beendifferent than they actually are, while other things could not havebeen. These modal judgments and modal claims therefore play a centralrole in human decision-making and in philosophical argumentation. Thisentry is about the justification we have for modal judgments., Most of the time, we encounter what might be called ordinarymodal judgments, such as the following:, However, philosophers often, in the course of an argument, formulatewhat might be called extraordinary modal judgements; thesetypically are about some special philosophical concept relevant to thediscussion. Here are some examples:, St. AnselmNecessarily: God exists., DescartesIt is possible for the mind to exist without the body., BerkeleyIt is impossible for anything to exist unperceived., Now a modal argument is one in which either a premise or theconclusion is an ordinary or an extraordinary modal judgment. Thus, inmodal arguments, we reason about what is necessary, possible, orimpossible, or about what might, must, or could not be the case. Modalarguments can therefore be found both inside and outside of philosophy(within philosophy many important philosophical positions are in factmodal positions). Assuming that a modal argument is valid (i.e., thepremises validly imply the conclusion), then the evaluation of a modalargument focuses on whether the premises are justified. The questionthen arises: how does one show that a modal premise of a modalargument is justified?, Philosophers have long been interested in how a modal claim can beknown, justified, or understood. The philosophy of modality is thearea in which one studies the metaphysics, semantics, epistemology,and logic of modal claims—that is, claims about what isnecessary, possible, contingent, essential, and accidental.Epistemology is the general area of philosophy in which one studiesthe nature of knowledge. The central questions of epistemologyconcern: (i) what it is to know something, (ii) what it is to bejustified in believing something, (iii) what it is to understandsomething, and (iv) what are the means by which we can come to possessunderstanding, justification, or knowledge. Within the philosophy ofmodality one finds the sub-discipline known as the epistemology ofmodality. The central question of this field is:, This is similar to the central questions found in the epistemology ofmathematics and morality, where one inquires into, the nature ofmathematical knowledge or moral knowledge. Special interest in modalepistemology (another name for the epistemology of modality) oftenderives from the following contrast between knowledge of the actualand knowledge of what could have been and could not have been thecase., In general, perception of the actual world can guide us to knowledgeof realized possibilities, possibilities that are actual. Formost philosophers hold that given that what is actual is possible,knowledge of actuality can inform us of knowledge of somepossibilities. However, actuality appears to be aninsufficient guide to what is: (a) merely possible,since the possibility is not realized, or (b) impossible,since what is actually the case does not tell us what could not bethe case. To better understand this phenomenon, consider a cup,ccc, located at LLL at time ttt. The following line of reasoningillustrates the central question and its special interest in the caseof ordinary possibilities., With respect to the epistemic question, all of the following have beenproposed as potential answers:, In addition to these theories, one overarching idea is that they caneither be offered as part of a uniformity account or as part of anon-uniformity account of modal knowledge. The uniformityview holds that there is only one single route to modal knowledgeat the most fundamental level of explanation. Thenon-uniformity view maintains either that differentpeople can come to know the same modal truth through different routesor that at the fundamental level of investigation there must be morethan one route to modal knowledge., In addition to the central question there are three other mainquestions of interest., Modal Sorting:how can we knowledgeably sort necessary truths from essential truthsand contingent truths? , At least one point of interest in the sorting question derives fromwork in the metaphysics of modality. Necessity and possibility areinterdefinable, PPP is necessary when it is not possible thatnot-PPP. However, some such as Fine (1994), have argued that essencecannot be defined in terms of necessity. This leads us to thequestion: how can we sort the essential from the necessary?, Modal Skepticism:what are the limits of modal knowledge? , At least one point of interest in the skeptical question derives fromwork on the range of modal knowledge. All theories of modal knowledgeshould be able to account for ordinary cases. However, some, such asVan Inwagen (1998), have presented skeptical arguments about extendingmodal knowledge to a variety of exotic philosophical claims. , Modal Architecture/Epistemic Priority:given that there is a distinction between necessity, possibility, andessence, is knowledge of one more fundamental than knowledgeof the others? For example is our knowledge of necessity morefundamental than our knowledge of possibility and essence, andadditionally a pathway to our knowledge of both possibility andessence? , At least one point of interest in the architecture/epistemic priorityquestion derives from work on the proper route to modal knowledge. BobHale (2003) has drawn an important distinction between necessity-firstand possibility-first approaches to modal knowledge. A necessity-firstapproach holds that we first arrive at knowledge of necessary truths,and then derive knowledge of possibility through compatibility withknowledge of necessity. A possibility-first approach holds that wefirst arrive at knowledge of possible truths, and then aim todetermine what necessary truths hold., It is important to take note of two points about general inquiry inthe epistemology of modality. First, the field is typically concernedwith investigating (i) alethic modality (modality concerned with whatcould have been true), as opposed to epistemic modality (modalityconcerned with what might be true in an epistemic sense of“might”) or deontic modality (modality concerned with whatmight be done in some normative or evaluative sense). Second, (ii) theinvestigation centers on metaphysical modality, as opposed to logicalor physical modality., For those that accept the reality of metaphysical inquiry,metaphysical modality is often understood as being themodality concerned with metaphysics as opposed to logical modality,which concerns itself with logical relations or physical modality,which concerns itself with physical relations. In addition, on thestandard model of the relation between these kinds ofmodalities the logical possibilities are the most inclusive; theyinclude any proposition that sheer logic leaves open, no matter howotherwise impossible it might be. The metaphysical possibilities arethe logical possibilities that are also allowed by the natures of allof the things that could have existed. The physical possibilities arethe logical and metaphysical possibilities that are also allowed bythe physical laws of nature. On the standard model, the followingnesting relation holds:, This entry will focus on a selection of theories in the epistemologyof modality.},

  abstract = {Modal statements tell us something about what could be or must be thecase. Such claims can come in many forms. Consider:, Each of these claims appears to have a true reading. But it also seemsthat ‘cannot’ needs to be interpreted in different ways tomake the different sentences true. For one thing, we can, in the samebreath, accept a modal claim in one of the senses illustrated by(1)–(10) while rejecting it in another one of these senses, asin the following dialogue:, Moreover, the modal claims (1)–(10) appear to be true forcompletely different reasons. For example, it may be held that thetruth of (1) is due to the meanings of its constituent expressions;that (2) holds because it lies in your nature to be born of youractual parents; that (3) is true because the laws of nature precludesuperluminal motion; that (4) holds because of technologicallimitations; that (5) owes its truth to the presence of insurmountablepractical obstacles; that (6)–(9) are made true by the demandsof morality, etiquette, the rules of chess, and the law respectively;and that (10) holds because the known facts prove Fred’sinnocence., It is one of the tasks of a philosophical theory of modality to give asystematic and unified account of this multiplicity of modal concepts.This article discusses a few of the main issues that need to beaddressed by anyone pursuing this goal. Sections 1 and 2 concern thequestion of what fundamental categories of modal notions there are.The focus will be on two contemporary debates: whether there areseparate forms of modality that are tied to the epistemic and themetaphysical domains (section 1), and whether there is a special kindof necessity associated with the laws of nature (section 2). Section 3discusses questions about the relations between different notions ofnecessity. Can some of them be reduced to other, more fundamentalones? If so, which concepts of necessity are the most fundamentalones? And if there are several fundamental kinds of necessity, what dothey have in common that makes them all kinds of necessity?},

  title = {Dynamic {{Semantics}}},
  edition = {Winter 2016},
  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/dynamic-semantics/},
  abstract = {Dynamic semantics is a perspective on natural language semantics thatemphasizes the growth of information in time. It is an approach tomeaning representation where pieces of text or discourse are viewed asinstructions to update an existing context with new information, theresult of which is an updated context. In a slogan: meaning is contextchange potential. , It is important to be aware of the abstractness of this perspective soas to guard against various non sequiturs. For one thing, one couldeasily think that dynamic semantics or update semantics is committedat least in part to an internalist idea of semantics since theinformation states are “internal”—in the sense thatthey are wholly contained in the individual mind/brain. In otherwords, one might think that the information states of dynamicsemantics are what Putnam (1975) calls “states in the sense ofmethodological solipsism”. See the entries on scientific realism, computational theory of mind, externalism about mental content, and narrow mental content. However, the general framework says nothing about what the statesare. The state could very well include the environment in which theinterpreter is embedded and thus contain an “external”component., A second possible misunderstanding is that dynamic semantics or updatesemantics is in complete opposition to classical truth conditionalsemantics (compare the entries on classical logic and first-order model theory). In fact, as this entry will soon make clear, what dynamic semanticsprovides is a generalization of truth conditional semantics ratherthan a radically different alternative. The classical meanings becomethe preconditions for success of the discourse actions.Dynamic semanticists claim that compositional meanings havethe nature of functions or relations and the classical meanings arerecoverable from the relational dynamic meanings asprojections onto their “input” coordinate., The point of the use of an abstract framework is not to give empiricalpredictions. This is the task of specific realizations inside theframework. The framework of dynamic semantics (i) provides a directionof thinking and (ii) allows us to import methods from the mathematicalstudy of the framework. It follows that the question whether naturallanguage meaning is intrinsically dynamic does not have an empiricalanswer. Still, what can be said is that the study of interpretation asa linearly-ordered process has proven quite fruitful andrewarding., Since dynamic semantics focuses on the discourse actions of sender andreceiver, it is in a sense close to use-oriented approaches to meaningin philosophy such as the work of Wittgenstein and Dummett. However,easy identifications between dynamic semantics and these approachesare to be avoided. Dynamic semantics as an abstract framework iscompatible with many philosophical ways of viewing meaning andinterpretation. Dynamic semantics aims to model meaning andinterpretation. You can do that without answering broaderphilosophical questions such as the question of what it is that makesit possible for the subject to be related to these meanings at all.For example, in dynamic predicate logic we take the meaning ofhorse as given without making any substantial claim aboutwhat it means for a subject to have the concept of horse; wejust stipulate the subject has it. This is not to say suchquestions—which are at the center of the work of Wittgensteinand Dummett—should not ultimately be answered: it’s justthat a model can be of interest even if it does not answer them. (Notethat dynamic semantics tries to give a systematic and compositionalaccount of meaning, which makes it markedly different in spirit fromWittgenstein’s later philosophy.), One approach to dynamic semantics is discourse representation theory (DRT, Kamp 1981). (Closely related to Kamp’s approach is IreneHeim’s file change semantics (FCS, Heim 1983a) and thediscourse semantics of Seuren 1985). Meanings in DRT are so-calleddiscourse representation structures (DRSs). These structuresare a type of database that contains specific pieces of information.In and of itself a DRS is a static object, but DRT can be said to be adynamic semantic framework because it allows us to understand theprocess of composing meanings as a process of mergingdiscourse representation structures. In this way, information changebecomes an integral part of the interpretation process., Our main focus in this entry is a second approach to dynamicsemantics, although we will compare things to DRT along the way. Inthis second approach, dynamic meanings are types of actions, thingsthat are individuated by the changes they effect. This is the approachassociated with dynamic predicate logic (DPL, Groenendijk andStokhof 1991a). According to this dynamic semantic tradition, ameaning is a specification of how a receiver’s information statewould be modified. It could for instance be a function that maps anold information state to one which has been updated with theinformation that the meaning embodies. Alternatively, it could be arelation that expresses the kind of information change that themeaning brings about. (For early work in this tradition, seeGroenendijk and Stokhof 1991a,b; Muskens 1991; Dekker 1993; Vermeulen1993; van Eijck 1994; Vermeulen 1994; Krahmer 1995; van den Berg 1996;Groenendijk et al. 1996; Aloni 1997; Muskens et al. 1997).},

The truth of thepremises of a good defeasible argument provide support for theconclusion, even though it is possible for the premises to be true andthe conclusion false. In other words, the relationship of supportbetween premises and conclusion is a tentative one, potentiallydefeated by additional information. Philosophers have studied thenature of defeasible reasoning since Aristotle’s analysis ofdialectical reasoning in the Topics and thePosterior Analytics, but the subject has been studied withunique intensity over the last forty years, largely due to theinterest it attracted from the artificial intelligence movement incomputer science. There have been two approaches to the study ofreasoning: treating it either as a branch of epistemology (the studyof knowledge) or as a branch of logic. In recent work, the termdefeasible reasoning has typically been limited to inferencesinvolving rough-and-ready, exception-permitting generalizations, thatis, inferring what has or will happen on the basis of whatnormally happens. This narrower sense of defeasiblereasoning, which will be the subject of this article, excludesfrom the topic the study of other forms of non-deductive reasoning,including inference to the best explanation, abduction, analogicalreasoning, and scientific induction. This exclusion is to some extentartificial, but it reflects the fact that the formal study of theseother forms of non-deductive reasoning remains quite rudimentary.},

However, suchpatterns are beyond reach for classical logic (CL), intuitionisticlogic (IL) or other logics that characterize deductive reasoning sincethey—by their very nature—do not allow for a retractionof inferences. The challenge tackled in the domain of NMLs is toprovide for defeasible reasoning forms what CL or IL provide formathematical reasoning: namely a formally precise account thatis materially adequate, where material adequacy concerns thequestion of how broad a range of examples is captured by theframework, and the extent to which the framework can do justice to ourintuitions on the subject (at least the most entrenched ones).},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (which I'll refer to hereafter by its nickname,“AI”) is the subfield of Computer Science devoted to developingprograms that enable computers to display behavior that can (broadly)be characterized as intelligent.[1] Most research in AI is devoted tofairly narrow applications, such as planning or speech-to-speechtranslation in limited, well defined task domains. But substantialinterest remains in the long-range goal of building generallyintelligent, autonomous agents,[2] even if the goal of fully human-like intelligence is elusive andis seldom pursued explicitly and as such., Throughout its relatively short history, AI has been heavilyinfluenced by logical ideas. AI has drawn on many researchmethodologies:  the value and relative importance of logical formalismsis questioned by some leading practitioners, and has been debated inthe literature from time to time.[3] But most members of the AI communitywould agree that logic has an important role to play in at least somecentral areas of AI research, and an influential minority considerslogic to be the most important factor in enabling strategic,fundamental advances., The relations between AI and philosophical logic are part of alarger story. It is hard to find a major philosophical theme thatdoesn't become entangled with issues having to do with reasoning.Implicatures, for instance, have to correspond to inferences that canbe carried out by a rational interpreter of discourse. Whatevercausality is, causal relations should be inferrable in everyday commonsense settings. Whatever belief is, it should be possible for rationalagents to make plausible inferences about the beliefs of other agents.The goals and standing constraints that inform a rational agent'sbehavior must permit the formation of reasonable plans., In each of these cases, compatibility with an acceptable account ofthe relevant reasoning is essential for a successful philosophicaltheory. But the methods in the contemporary philosophical inventory aretoo crude to provide anything like an adequate account of reasoningthat is this complex and this entangled in broad world knowledge., Bringing an eclectic set of conceptual tools to the problem ofidealized reasoning in realistic settings, and using computers to modeland test the theories, research in AI has transformed the study ofreasoning—especially of practical, common sense reasoning. Thisprocess and its outcome is well documented in Russell \& Norvig 2010., The new insights and theories that have emerged from AI are, Ibelieve, of great potential value in informing and constraining manyareas of philosophical inquiry. The special case of philosophical logic thatforms the theme of this article may provide support for the moregeneral point. Although logic in AI grew out of philosophical logic, inits new setting it has produced new theories and ambitious programsthat would not have been possible outside of a community devoted tobuilding full-scale computational models of rational agency., I imagine that the audience for this entry will consist primarily ofphilosophers who have little or no familiarity with AI. In writing thissurvey, I have tried to concentrate on the issues that arise when logicis used in understanding problems in intelligent reasoning and guidingthe design of mechanized reasoning systems. Logic in AI is a large andrapidly growing field—I haven't tried to achieve anything likecomplete coverage. In Section 3 and Section 4 I have tried to provide an overview with some historical andtechnical details concerning nonmonotonic logic and reasoning aboutaction and change, a topic that is not only central in AI but thatshould be of considerable interest to philosophers. The remainingsections provide brief and more or less inadequate sketches ofselected topics, with references to the primary literature.,  Minker 2000b is a comprehensivecollection of survey papers and original contributions to the field oflogic-based AI, with extensive references to the literature.  Jack Minker'sintroduction, Minker 2000a, is a usefulorientation to the field. I recommend this volume asa beginning point for readers who wish to pursue this topicfurther.  Brachman\& Levesque 2004a provides an introduction to the field ofknowledge representation in textbook form.  Davis 1991a andMueller 2006a are book-length treatmentsof the challenging problem of formalizing commonsense reasoning.  Antonelli 2012a is a good entry pointfor readers interested in nonmonotonic logic, andShanahan 2009a is a useful discussion ofthe frame problem.  Wooldridge 2000a deals with logicalformalizations of rational agents., Contents of this entry:},

  url = {https://blog.jle.im/entry/purely-functional-typed-models-1.html},
  abstract = {With the release of backprop, I’ve been exploring the space of parameterized models of all sorts, from linear and logistic regression and other statistical models to artificial neural networks, feed-forward and recurrent (stateful). I wanted to see to what extent we can really apply automatic differentiation and iterative gradient decent-based training to all of these different models. Basically, I wanted to see how far we can take differentiable programming (a la Yann LeCun) as a paradigm for writing trainable models. Building on other writers, I’m starting to see a picture unifying all of these models, painted in the language of purely typed functional programming. I’m already applying these to models I’m using in real life and in my research, and I thought I’d take some time to put my thoughts to writing in case anyone else finds these illuminating or useful. As a big picture, I really believe that a purely functional typed approach to differentiable programming is the way to move forward in the future for models like artificial neural networks. In this light, the drawbacks of object-oriented and imperative approaches becomes very apparent. I’m not the first person to attempt to build a conceptual framework for these types of models in a purely functional typed sense – Christopher Olah’s famous post wrote a great piece in 2015 that this post heavily builds off of, and is definitely worth a read! We’ll be taking some of his ideas and seeing how they work in real code! This will be a three-part series, and the intended audience is people who have a passing familiarity with statistical modeling or machine learning/deep learning. The code in these posts is written in Haskell, using the backprop and hmatrix (with hmatrix-backprop) libraries, but the main themes and messages won’t be about haskell, but rather about differentiable programming in a purely functional typed setting in general. This isn’t a Haskell post as much as it is an exploration, using Haskell syntax/libraries to implement the points. The backprop library is roughly equivalent to autograd in python, so all of the ideas apply there as well. The source code for the written code in this module is available on github, if you want to follow along!},
